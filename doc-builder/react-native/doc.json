This page will help you install React Native on\nyour system, so that you can build apps with it right away. If you already\nhave React Native installed, you can skip ahead to the\nTutorial.The instructions are a bit different depending on your development operating system, and whether you want to start developing for iOS or Android. If you\nwant to develop for both iOS and Android, that's fine - you just have to pick\none to start with, since the setup is a bit different.\n  \n  Mobile OS:\n  iOS\n  Android\n  Development OS:\n  macOS\n  Linux\n  Windows\n\n\n\n\nUnsupported #Unfortunately, Apple only lets you develop for iOS on a Mac. If you want to build an iOS app but you don't have a Mac yet, you can try starting with the Android instructions instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Dependencies #You will need Node.js, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.\n\nInstalling Dependencies #You will need Node.js, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Android Studio.\n\nInstalling Dependencies #You will need Node.js, the React Native command line interface, and Android Studio.\n\nNode, Watchman #We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:brew install node\nbrew install watchmanWatchman is a tool by Facebook for watching\nchanges in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.\n\nNode #Follow the installation instructions for your Linux distribution to install Node.js 4 or newer.\n\nNode #We recommend installing Node.js and Python2 via Chocolatey, a popular package manager for Windows. Open a Command Prompt as Administrator, then run:choco install nodejs.install\nchoco install python2You can find additional installation options on Node.js's Downloads page.\n\nThe React Native CLI #Node.js comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.Run the following command in a Terminal:npm install -g react-native-cliIf you get an error like Cannot find module 'npmlog', try installing npm directly: curl -0 -L https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh.\n\nThe React Native CLI #Node.js comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.Run the following command in a Terminal:npm install -g react-native-cliIf you get an error like Cannot find module 'npmlog', try installing npm directly: curl -0 -L https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh.\n\nXcode #The easiest way to install Xcode 8 is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose \"Preferences...\" from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.\n\nAndroid Development Environment #Setting up your development environment can be somewhat tedious if you're new to Android development. If you're already familiar with Android development, there are a few things you may need to configure. In either case, please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.1. Download and install Android Studio #Android Studio provides the Android SDK and AVD (emulator) required to run and test your React Native apps.\n\nAndroid Studio requires a recent version of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK).\n\n2. Install the AVD and HAXM #Android Virtual Devices allow you to run Android apps on your computer without the need for an actual Android phone or tablet. Choose Custom installation when running Android Studio for the first time. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked:Android SDKAndroid SDK PlatformPerformance (Intel ® HAXM)Android Virtual DeviceThen, click \"Next\" to install all of these components.If you've already installed Android Studio before, you can still install HAXM without performing a custom installation.\n\n2. Install the AVD and configure VM acceleration #Android Virtual Devices allow you to run Android apps on your computer without the need for an actual Android phone or tablet. Choose Custom installation when running Android Studio for the first time. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked:Android SDKAndroid SDK PlatformAndroid Virtual DeviceClick \"Next\" to install all of these components, then configure VM acceleration on your system.\n\n3. Install the Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) SDK #Android Studio installs the most recent Android SDK by default. React Native, however, requires the Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) SDK. To install it, launch the SDK Manager, click on \"Configure\" > \"SDK Manager\" in the \"Welcome to Android Studio\" screen.The SDK Manager can also be found within the Android Studio \"Preferences\" menu, under Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → Android SDK.Select the \"SDK Platforms\" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to \"Show Package Details\" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) entry, then make sure the following items are all checked:Google APIsAndroid SDK Platform 23Intel x86 Atom_64 System ImageGoogle APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System ImageNext, select the \"SDK Tools\" tab and check the box next to \"Show Package Details\" here as well. Look for and expand the \"Android SDK Build Tools\" entry, then make sure that Android SDK Build-Tools 23.0.1 is selected.Finally, click \"Apply\" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.\n\n4. Set up the ANDROID_HOME environment variable #The React Native command line interface requires the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to be set up.\n\nAdd the following lines to your ~/.profile (or equivalent) config file:export ANDROID_HOME=${HOME}/Library/Android/sdk\nexport PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools\nexport PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-toolsType source ~/.profile to load the config into your current shell.Please make sure you export the correct path for ANDROID_HOME. If you installed the Android SDK using Homebrew, it would be located at /usr/local/opt/android-sdk.\n\nAdd the following lines to your ~/.profile (or equivalent) config file:export ANDROID_HOME=${HOME}/Android/Sdk\nexport PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools\nexport PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-toolsType source ~/.profile to load the config into your current shell.Please make sure you export the correct path for ANDROID_HOME if you did not install the Android SDK using Android Studio.\n\nGo to Control Panel → System and Security → System → Change settings →\nAdvanced System Settings → Environment variables → New, then enter the path to your Android SDK.Restart the Command Prompt to apply the new environment variable.Please make sure you export the correct path for ANDROID_HOME if you did not install the Android SDK using Android Studio.\n\nWatchman (optional) #Follow the Watchman installation guide to compile and install Watchman from source.Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching\nchanges in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance, but it's alright to skip this if you find the process to be tedious.\n\nStarting the Android Virtual Device #You can see the list of available AVDs by opening the \"AVD Manager\" from within Android Studio. You can also run the following command in a terminal:android avdOnce in the \"AVD Manager\", select your AVD and click \"Edit...\". Choose \"Android 6.0 - API Level 23\" under Device, and \"Intel Atom (x86_64)\" under CPU/ABI. Click OK, then select your new AVD and click \"Start...\", and finally, \"Launch\".It is very common to run into an issue where Android Studio fails to create a default AVD. You may follow the Android Studio User Guide to create a new AVD manually if needed.Using a real device #If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD. Plug it in to your computer using a USB cable and enable USB debugging before proceeding to the next step.\n\nTesting your React Native Installation #\n\nUse the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called \"AwesomeProject\", then run react-native run-ios inside the newly created folder.react-native init AwesomeProject\ncd AwesomeProject\nreact-native run-iosYou should see your new app running in the iOS Simulator shortly.react-native run-ios is just one way to run your app. You can also run it directly from within Xcode or Nuclide.\n\nUse the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called \"AwesomeProject\", then run react-native run-android inside the newly created folder:react-native init AwesomeProject\ncd AwesomeProject\nreact-native run-androidIf everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android emulator shortly.react-native run-android is just one way to run your app - you can also run it directly from within Android Studio or Nuclide.\n\nModifying your app #Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.\n\nOpen index.ios.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.Hit Command⌘ + R in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your change!\n\nOpen index.android.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.Press the R key twice or select Reload from the Developer Menu to see your change!\n\nThat's it! #Congratulations!

So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components. This\ntutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether you have React experience or not.Let's do this thing.Hello World #In accordance with the ancient traditions of our people, we must first build an app that does nothing except say \"Hello world\". Here it is:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';\n\nclass HelloWorldApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Text>Hello world!</Text>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorldApp', () => HelloWorldApp);If you are feeling curious, you can play around with sample code directly in the web simulators. You can also paste it into your index.ios.js or index.android.js file to create a real app on your local machine.What's going on here? #Some of the things in here might not look like JavaScript to you. Don't panic. This is the future.First of all, ES2015 (also known as ES6) is a set of improvements to JavaScript that is now part of the official standard, but not yet supported by all browsers, so often it isn't used yet in web development. React Native ships with ES2015 support, so you can use this stuff without worrying about compatibility. import, from, class, extends, and the () => syntax in the example above are all ES2015 features. If you aren't familiar with ES2015, you can probably pick it up just by reading through sample code like this tutorial has. If you want, this page has a good overview of ES2015 features.The other unusual thing in this code example is <Text>Hello world!</Text>. This is JSX - a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript. Many frameworks use a special templating language which lets you embed code inside markup language. In React, this is reversed. JSX lets you write your markup language inside code. It looks like HTML on the web, except instead of web things like <div> or <span>, you use React components. In this case, <Text>\nis a built-in component that just displays some text.Component and AppRegistry #So this code is defining HelloWorldApp, a new Component, and it's registering it with the AppRegistry. When you're building a React Native app, you'll be making new components a lot. Anything you see on the screen is some sort of component. A component can be pretty simple - the only thing that's required is a render function which returns some JSX to render.The AppRegistry just tells React Native which component is the root one for the whole application. You won't be thinking about AppRegistry a lot - there will probably just be one call to AppRegistry.registerComponent in your whole app. It's included in these examples so you can paste the whole thing into your index.ios.js or index.android.js file and get it running.This App Doesn't Do Very Much #Good point. To make components do more interesting things, you need to learn about Props.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Props","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props.html","content":"Props #Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These creation parameters are called props.For example, one basic React Native component is the Image. When you\ncreate an image, you can use a prop named source to control what image it shows.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Image } from 'react-native';\n\nclass Bananas extends Component {\n  render() {\n    let pic = {\n      uri: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Bananavarieties.jpg'\n    };\n    return (\n      <Image source={pic} style={{width: 193, height: 110}}/>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('Bananas', () => Bananas);Notice that {pic} is surrounded by braces, to embed the variable pic into JSX. You can put any JavaScript expression inside braces in JSX.Your own components can also use props. This lets you make a single component\nthat is used in many different places in your app, with slightly different\nproperties in each place. Just refer to this.props in your render function. Here's an example:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Text>Hello {this.props.name}!</Text>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass LotsOfGreetings extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={{alignItems: 'center'}}>\n        <Greeting name='Rexxar' />\n        <Greeting name='Jaina' />\n        <Greeting name='Valeera' />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('LotsOfGreetings', () => LotsOfGreetings);Using name as a prop lets us customize the Greeting component, so we can reuse that component for each of our greetings. This example also uses the Greeting component in JSX, just like the built-in components. The power to do this is what makes React so cool - if you find yourself wishing that you had a different set of UI primitives to work with, you just invent new ones.The other new thing going on here is the View component. A View is useful\nas a container for other components, to help control style and layout.With props and the basic Text, Image, and View components, you can\nbuild a wide variety of static screens. To learn how to make your app change over time, you need to learn about State.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"State","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html","content":"State #There are two types of data that control a component: props and state. props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component. For data that is going to change, we have to use state.In general, you should initialize state in the constructor, and then call setState when you want to change it.For example, let's say we want to make text that blinks all the time. The text itself gets set once when the blinking component gets created, so the text itself is a prop. The \"whether the text is currently on or off\" changes over time, so that should be kept in state.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass Blink extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {showText: true};\n\n    // Toggle the state every second\n    setInterval(() => {\n      this.setState({ showText: !this.state.showText });\n    }, 1000);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    let display = this.state.showText ? this.props.text : ' ';\n    return (\n      <Text>{display}</Text>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass BlinkApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <Blink text='I love to blink' />\n        <Blink text='Yes blinking is so great' />\n        <Blink text='Why did they ever take this out of HTML' />\n        <Blink text='Look at me look at me look at me' />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('BlinkApp', () => BlinkApp);In a real application, you probably won't be setting state with a timer. You might set state when you have new data arrive from the server, or from user input. You can also use a state container like Redux to control your data flow. In that case you would use Redux to modify your state rather than calling setState directly.State works the same way as it does in React, so for more details on handling state, you can look at the React.Component API.At this point, you might be annoyed that most of our examples so far use boring default black text. To make things more beautiful, you will have to learn about Style.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Style","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/style.html","content":"Style #With React Native, you don't use a special language or syntax for  defining styles. You just style your application using JavaScript. All of the core components accept a prop named style. The style names and values usually match how CSS works on the web, except names are written using camel casing, e.g backgroundColor rather than background-color.The style prop can be a plain old JavaScript object. That's the simplest and what we usually use for example code. You can also pass an array of styles - the last style in the array has precedence, so you can use this to inherit styles.As a component grows in complexity, it is often cleaner to use StyleSheet.create to define several styles in one place. Here's an example:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass LotsOfStyles extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <Text style={styles.red}>just red</Text>\n        <Text style={styles.bigblue}>just bigblue</Text>\n        <Text style={[styles.bigblue, styles.red]}>bigblue, then red</Text>\n        <Text style={[styles.red, styles.bigblue]}>red, then bigblue</Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  bigblue: {\n    color: 'blue',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n    fontSize: 30,\n  },\n  red: {\n    color: 'red',\n  },\n});\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('LotsOfStyles', () => LotsOfStyles);One common pattern is to make your component accept a style prop which in\nturn is used to style subcomponents. You can use this to make styles \"cascade\" the way they do in CSS.There are a lot more ways to customize text style. Check out the Text component reference for a complete list.Now you can make your text beautiful. The next step in becoming a style master is to learn how to control component size.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Height and Width","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/height-and-width.html","content":"Height and Width #A component's height and width determine its size on the screen.Fixed Dimensions #The simplest way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed width and height to style. All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass FixedDimensionsBasics extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} />\n        <View style={{width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'}} />\n        <View style={{width: 150, height: 150, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => FixedDimensionsBasics);Setting dimensions this way is common for components that should always render at exactly the same size, regardless of screen dimensions.Flex Dimensions #Use flex in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically based on available space. Normally you will use flex: 1, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly amongst each other component with the same parent. The larger the flex given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than 0. If a parent does not have either a fixed width and height or flex, the parent will have dimensions of 0 and the flex children will not be visible.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass FlexDimensionsBasics extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      // Try removing the `flex: 1` on the parent View.\n      // The parent will not have dimensions, so the children can't expand.\n      // What if you add `height: 300` instead of `flex: 1`?\n      <View style={{flex: 1}}>\n        <View style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} />\n        <View style={{flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'}} />\n        <View style={{flex: 3, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => FlexDimensionsBasics);After you can control a component's size, the next step is to learn how to lay it out on the screen.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Layout with Flexbox","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flexbox.html","content":"Layout with Flexbox #A component can specify the layout of its children using the flexbox algorithm. Flexbox is designed to provide a consistent layout on different screen sizes.You will normally use a combination of flexDirection, alignItems, and justifyContent to achieve the right layout.Flexbox works the same way in React Native as it does in CSS on the web, with a few exceptions. The defaults are different, with flexDirection defaulting to column instead of row, and the flex parameter only supporting a single number.Flex Direction #Adding flexDirection to a component's style determines the primary axis of its layout. Should the children be organized horizontally (row) or vertically (column)? The default is column.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass FlexDirectionBasics extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      // Try setting `flexDirection` to `column`.\n      <View style={{flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row'}}>\n        <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} />\n        <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'}} />\n        <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => FlexDirectionBasics);Justify Content #Adding justifyContent to a component's style determines the distribution of children along the primary axis.

Should children be aligned at the start, the center, the end, or stretched to fill? Available options are flex-start, center, flex-end, and stretch.For stretch to have an effect, children must not have a fixed dimension along the secondary axis.

It has an onChangeText prop that takes\na function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words  into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence \"Hello there Bob\" would be translated\nas \"🍕🍕🍕\".import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass PizzaTranslator extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {text: ''};\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={{padding: 10}}>\n        <TextInput\n          style={{height: 40}}\n          placeholder=\"Type here to translate!\"\n          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n        />\n        <Text style={{padding: 10, fontSize: 42}}>\n          {this.state.text.split(' ').map((word) => word && '🍕').join(' ')}\n        </Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('PizzaTranslator', () => PizzaTranslator);In this example, we store text in the state, because it changes over time.There are a lot more things you might want to do with a text input. For example, you could validate the text inside while the user types. For more detailed examples, see the React docs on controlled components, or the reference docs for TextInput.Text input is probably the simplest example of a component whose state naturally changes over time.

The scrollable items need not be homogenous, and you can scroll both vertically and horizontally (by setting the horizontal property).This example creates a vertical ScrollView with both images and text mixed together.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, ScrollView, Image, Text } from 'react-native'\n\nclass IScrolledDownAndWhatHappenedNextShockedMe extends Component {\n  render() {\n      return (\n        <ScrollView>\n          <Text style={{fontSize:96}}>Scroll me plz</Text>\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Text style={{fontSize:96}}>If you like</Text>\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Text style={{fontSize:96}}>Scrolling down</Text>\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Text style={{fontSize:96}}>What's the best</Text>\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Text style={{fontSize:96}}>Framework around?</Text>\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />\n          <Text style={{fontSize:80}}>React Native</Text>\n        </ScrollView>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent(\n  'IScrolledDownAndWhatHappenedNextShockedMe',\n  () => IScrolledDownAndWhatHappenedNextShockedMe);ScrollView works best to present a small amount of things of a limited size. All the elements and views of a ScrollView are rendered, even if they are not currently shown on the screen. If you have a long list of more items that can fit on the screen, you should use a ListView instead. So let's learn about the ListView next.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Using a ListView","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/using-a-listview.html","content":"Using a ListView #The ListView component displays a scrolling list of changing, but similarly structured, data.ListView works well for long lists of data, where the number of items might change over time. Unlike the more generic ScrollView, the ListView only renders elements that are currently showing on the screen, not all the elements at once.The ListView component requires two props: dataSource and renderRow. dataSource is the source of information for the list. renderRow takes one item from the source and returns a formatted component to render.This example creates a simple ListView of hardcoded data. It first initializes the dataSource that will be used to populate the ListView. Each item in the dataSource is then rendered as a Text component. Finally it renders the ListView and all Text components.A rowHasChanged function is required to use ListView. Here we just say a row has changed if the row we are on is not the same as the previous row.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, ListView, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass ListViewBasics extends Component {\n  // Initialize the hardcoded data\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    const ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});\n    this.state = {\n      dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows([\n        'John', 'Joel', 'James', 'Jimmy', 'Jackson', 'Jillian', 'Julie', 'Devin'\n      ])\n    };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={{flex: 1, paddingTop: 22}}>\n        <ListView\n          dataSource={this.state.dataSource}\n          renderRow={(rowData) => <Text>{rowData}</Text>}\n        />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// App registration and rendering\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('ListViewBasics', () => ListViewBasics);One of the most common uses for a ListView is displaying data that you fetch from a server. To do that, you will need to learn about networking in React Native.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Networking","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html","content":"Networking #Many mobile apps need to load resources from a remote URL. You may want to make a POST request to a REST API, or you may simply need to fetch a chunk of static content from another server.Using Fetch #React Native provides the Fetch API for your networking needs. Fetch will seem familiar if you have used XMLHttpRequest or other networking APIs before. You may refer to MDN's guide on Using Fetch for additional information.Making requests #In order to fetch content from an arbitrary URL, just pass the URL to fetch:fetch('https://mywebsite.com/mydata.json')Fetch also takes an optional second argument that allows you to customize the HTTP request. You may want to specify additional headers, or make a POST request:fetch('https://mywebsite.com/endpoint/', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Accept': 'application/json',\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    firstParam: 'yourValue',\n    secondParam: 'yourOtherValue',\n  })\n})Take a look at the Fetch Request docs for a full list of properties.Handling the response #The above examples show how you can make a request. In many cases, you will want to do something with the response.Networking is an inherently asynchronous operation. Fetch methods will return a  Promise that makes it straightforward to write code that works in an asynchronous manner:  function getMoviesFromApiAsync() {\n    return fetch('https://facebook.github.io/react-native/movies.json')\n      .then((response) => response.json())\n      .then((responseJson) => {\n        return responseJson.movies;\n      })\n      .catch((error) => {\n        console.error(error);\n      });\n  }You can also use the proposed ES2017 async/await syntax in a React Native app:  async function getMoviesFromApi() {\n    try {\n      let response = await fetch('https://facebook.github.io/react-native/movies.json');\n      let responseJson = await response.json();\n      return responseJson.movies;\n    } catch(error) {\n      console.error(error);\n    }\n  }Don't forget to catch any errors that may be thrown by fetch, otherwise they will be dropped silently.By default, iOS will block any request that's not encrypted using SSL. If you need to fetch from a cleartext URL (one that begins with http) you will first need to add an App Transport Security exception. If you know ahead of time what domains you will need access to, it is more secure to add exceptions just for those domains; if the domains are not known until runtime you can disable ATS completely. Note however that from January 2017, Apple's App Store review will require reasonable justification for disabling ATS. See Apple's documentation for more information.Using Other Networking Libraries #The XMLHttpRequest API is built in to React Native. This means that you can use third party libraries such as frisbee or axios that depend on it, or you can use the XMLHttpRequest API directly if you prefer.var request = new XMLHttpRequest();\nrequest.onreadystatechange = (e) => {\n  if (request.readyState !== 4) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  if (request.status === 200) {\n    console.log('success', request.responseText);\n  } else {\n    console.warn('error');\n  }\n};\n\nrequest.open('GET', 'https://mywebsite.com/endpoint/');\nrequest.send();The security model for XMLHttpRequest is different than on web as there is no concept of CORS in native apps.WebSocket Support #React Native also supports WebSockets, a protocol which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.var ws = new WebSocket('ws://host.com/path');\n\nws.onopen = () => {\n  // connection opened\n\n  ws.send('something'); // send a message\n};\n\nws.onmessage = (e) => {\n  // a message was received\n  console.log(e.data);\n};\n\nws.onerror = (e) => {\n  // an error occurred\n  console.log(e.message);\n};\n\nws.onclose = (e) => {\n  // connection closed\n  console.log(e.code, e.reason);\n};Your app can now display all sorts of data and you may soon need to organize this content into several screens. To manage the transition between these screens, you will need to learn about navigators.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"More Resources","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/more-resources.html","content":"More Resources #If you just read through this website, you should be able to build a pretty cool React Native app. But React Native isn't just a product made by one company - it's a community of thousands of developers.

We will now install a CocoaPods Podfile with the components you want to use from the framework itself.Subspecs #Before you integrate React Native into your application, you will want to decide what parts of the React Native Framework you would like to integrate. That is where subspecs come in. When you create your Podfile, you are going to specify React Native library dependencies that you will want installed so that your application can use those libraries. Each library will become a subspec in the Podfile.The list of supported subspecs are in node_modules/react-native/React.podspec. They are generally named by functionality. For example, you will generally always want the Core subspec. That will get you the AppRegistry, StyleSheet, View and other core React Native libraries. If you want to add the React Native Text library (e.g., for <Text> elements), then you will need the RCTText subspec. If you want the Image library (e.g., for <Image> elements), then you will need the RCTImage subspec.Podfile #After you have used Node to install the React and React Native frameworks into the node_modules directory, and you have decided on what React Native elements you want to integrate, you are ready to create your Podfile so you can install those components for use in your application.The easiest way to create a Podfile is by using the CocoaPods init command in the native iOS code directory of your project:## In the directory where your native iOS code is located (e.g., where your `.xcodeproj` file is located)\n$ pod initThe Podfile will be created and saved in the iOS directory (e.g., ios/) of your current project and will contain a boilerplate setup that you will tweak for your integration purposes. In the end, Podfile should look something similar to this:\n\n# The target name is most likely the name of your project.\ntarget 'NumberTileGame' do\n\n  # Your 'node_modules' directory is probably in the root of your project,\n  # but if not, adjust the `:path` accordingly\n  pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [\n    'Core',\n    'RCTText',\n    'RCTNetwork',\n    'RCTWebSocket', # needed for debugging\n    # Add any other subspecs you want to use in your project\n  ]\n\nend\n\nsource 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'\n\n# Required for Swift apps\nplatform :ios, '8.0'\nuse_frameworks!\n\n# The target name is most likely the name of your project.\ntarget 'swift-2048' do\n\n  # Your 'node_modules' directory is probably in the root of your project,\n  # but if not, adjust the `:path` accordingly\n  pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [\n    'Core',\n    'RCTText',\n    'RCTNetwork',\n    'RCTWebSocket', # needed for debugging\n    # Add any other subspecs you want to use in your project\n  ]\n\nend\n\nPod Installation #After you have created your Podfile, you are ready to install the React Native pod.$ pod installYour should see output such as:Analyzing dependencies\nFetching podspec for `React` from `../node_modules/react-native`\nDownloading dependencies\nInstalling React (0.26.0)\nGenerating Pods project\nIntegrating client project\nSending stats\nPod installation complete!

The easiest path to take is to optionally create an event path to your component and then add that component to an existing ViewController.We will tie our React Native component with a new native view in the ViewController that will actually host it called RCTRootView .Create an Event Path #You can add a new link on the main game menu to go to the \"High Score\" React Native page.Event Handler #We will now add an event handler from the menu link. A method will be added to the main ViewController of your application. This is where RCTRootView comes into play.When you build a React Native application, you use the React Native packager to create an index.ios.bundle that will be served by the React Native server. Inside index.ios.bundle will be our RNHighScore module. So, we need to point our RCTRootView to the location of the index.ios.bundle resource (via NSURL) and tie it to the module.We will, for debugging purposes, log that the event handler was invoked. Then, we will create a string with the location of our React Native code that exists inside the index.ios.bundle. Finally, we will create the main RCTRootView. Notice how we provide RNHighScores as the moduleName that we created above when writing the code for our React Native component.\n\nFirst import the RCTRootView library.#import \"RCTRootView.h\"The initialProperties are here for illustration purposes so we have some data for our high score screen. In our React Native component, we will use this.props to get access to that data.- (IBAction)highScoreButtonPressed:(id)sender {\n    NSLog(@\"High Score Button Pressed\");\n    NSURL *jsCodeLocation = [NSURL\n                             URLWithString:@\"http://localhost:8081/index.ios.bundle?platform=ios\"];\n    RCTRootView *rootView =\n      [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL : jsCodeLocation\n                           moduleName        : @\"RNHighScores\"\n                           initialProperties :\n                             @{\n                               @\"scores\" : @[\n                                 @{\n                                   @\"name\" : @\"Alex\",\n                                   @\"value\": @\"42\"\n                                  },\n                                 @{\n                                   @\"name\" : @\"Joel\",\n                                   @\"value\": @\"10\"\n                                 }\n                               ]\n                             }\n                           launchOptions    : nil];\n    UIViewController *vc = [[UIViewController alloc] init];\n    vc.view = rootView;\n    [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil];\n}Note that RCTRootView initWithURL starts up a new JSC VM. To save resources and simplify the communication between RN views in different parts of your native app, you can have multiple views powered by React Native that are associated with a single JS runtime. To do that, instead of using [RCTRootView alloc] initWithURL, use RCTBridge initWithBundleURL to create a bridge and then use RCTRootView initWithBridge.\n\nFirst import the React library.import ReactThe initialProperties are here for illustration purposes so we have some data for our high score screen.

To do that, instead of using RCTRootView bundleURL, use RCTBridge initWithBundleURL to create a bridge and then use RCTRootView initWithBridge.\n\nWhen moving your app to production, the NSURL can point to a pre-bundled file on disk via something like [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@\"main\" withExtension:@\"jsbundle\"];. You can use the react-native-xcode.sh script in node_modules/react-native/packager/ to generate that pre-bundled file.\n\nWhen moving your app to production, the NSURL can point to a pre-bundled file on disk via something like let mainBundle = NSBundle(URLForResource: \"main\" withExtension:\"jsbundle\"). You can use the react-native-xcode.sh script in node_modules/react-native/packager/ to generate that pre-bundled file.\n\nWire Up #Wire up the new link in the main menu to the newly added event handler method.One of the easier ways to do this is to open the view in the storyboard and right click on the new link. Select something such as the Touch Up Inside event, drag that to the storyboard and then select the created method from the list provided.Test Your Integration #You have now done all the basic steps to integrate React Native with your current application.

Be sure to add it to the \"allprojects\" block:allprojects {\n    repositories {\n        ...\n        maven {\n            // All of React Native (JS, Android binaries) is installed from npm\n            url \"$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android\"\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n}Make sure that the path is correct! You shouldn’t run into any “Failed to resolve: com.facebook.react:react-native:0.x.x\" errors after running Gradle sync in Android Studio.Next, make sure you have the Internet permission in your AndroidManifest.xml:<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />If you need to access to the DevSettingsActivity add to your AndroidManifest.xml:<activity android:name=\"com.facebook.react.devsupport.DevSettingsActivity\" />This is only really used in dev mode when reloading JavaScript from the development server, so you can strip this in release builds if you need to.Add native code #You need to add some native code in order to start the React Native runtime and get it to render something. To do this, we're going to create an Activity that creates a ReactRootView, starts a React application inside it and sets it as the main content view.If you are targetting Android version <5, use the AppCompatActivity class from the com.android.support:appcompat package instead of Activity.public class MyReactActivity extends Activity implements DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler {\n    private ReactRootView mReactRootView;\n    private ReactInstanceManager mReactInstanceManager;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\n        mReactRootView = new ReactRootView(this);\n        mReactInstanceManager = ReactInstanceManager.builder()\n                .setApplication(getApplication())\n                .setBundleAssetName(\"index.android.bundle\")\n                .setJSMainModuleName(\"index.android\")\n                .addPackage(new MainReactPackage())\n                .setUseDeveloperSupport(BuildConfig.DEBUG)\n                .setInitialLifecycleState(LifecycleState.RESUMED)\n                .build();\n        mReactRootView.startReactApplication(mReactInstanceManager, \"HelloWorld\", null);\n\n        setContentView(mReactRootView);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void invokeDefaultOnBackPressed() {\n        super.onBackPressed();\n    }\n}If you are using a starter kit for React Native, replace the \"HelloWorld\" string with the one in your index.android.js file (it’s the first argument to the AppRegistry.registerComponent() method).If you are using Android Studio, use Alt + Enter to add all missing imports in your MyReactActivity class. Be careful to use your package’s BuildConfig and not the one from the ...facebook... package.We need set the theme of MyReactActivity to Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar because some components rely on this theme.<activity\n  android:name=\".MyReactActivity\"\n  android:label=\"@string/app_name\"\n  android:theme=\"@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n</activity>A ReactInstanceManager can be shared amongst multiple activities and/or fragments. You will want to make your own ReactFragment or ReactActivity and have a singleton holder that holds a ReactInstanceManager. When you need the ReactInstanceManager (e.g., to hook up the ReactInstanceManager to the lifecycle of those Activities or Fragments) use the one provided by the singleton.Next, we need to pass some activity lifecycle callbacks down to the ReactInstanceManager:@Override\nprotected void onPause() {\n    super.onPause();\n\n    if (mReactInstanceManager != null) {\n        mReactInstanceManager.onHostPause(this);\n    }\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected void onResume() {\n    super.onResume();\n\n    if (mReactInstanceManager != null) {\n        mReactInstanceManager.onHostResume(this, this);\n    }\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected void onDestroy() {\n    super.onDestroy();\n\n    if (mReactInstanceManager != null) {\n        mReactInstanceManager.onHostDestroy();\n    }\n}We also need to pass back button events to React Native:@Override\n public void onBackPressed() {\n    if (mReactInstanceManager != null) {\n        mReactInstanceManager.onBackPressed();\n    } else {\n        super.onBackPressed();\n    }\n}This allows JavaScript to control what happens when the user presses the hardware back button (e.g. to implement navigation). When JavaScript doesn't handle a back press, your invokeDefaultOnBackPressed method will be called. By default this simply finishes your Activity.Finally, we need to hook up the dev menu. By default, this is activated by (rage) shaking the device, but this is not very useful in emulators. So we make it show when you press the hardware menu button (use Ctrl + M if you're using Android Studio emulator):@Override\npublic boolean onKeyUp(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {\n    if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MENU && mReactInstanceManager != null) {\n        mReactInstanceManager.showDevOptionsDialog();\n        return true;\n    }\n    return super.onKeyUp(keyCode, event);\n}Now your activity is ready to run some JavaScript code.Configure permissions for development error overlay #If your app is targeting the Android API level 23 or greater, make sure you have the overlay permission enabled for the development build. You can check it with Settings.canDrawOverlays(this);. This is required in dev builds because react native development errors must be displayed above all the other windows. Due to the new permissions system introduced in the API level 23, the user needs to approve it. This can be acheived by adding the following code to the Activity file in the onCreate() method. OVERLAY_PERMISSION_REQ_CODE is a field of the class which would be responsible for passing the result back to the Activity.if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {\n    if (!Settings.canDrawOverlays(this)) {\n        Intent intent = new Intent(Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION,\n                                   Uri.parse(\"package:\" + getPackageName()));\n        startActivityForResult(intent, OVERLAY_PERMISSION_REQ_CODE);\n    }\n}Finally, the onActivityResult() method (as shown in the code below) has to be overridden to handle the permission Accepted or Denied cases for consistent UX.@Override\nprotected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n    if (requestCode == OVERLAY_PERMISSION_REQ_CODE) {\n        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {\n            if (!Settings.canDrawOverlays(this)) {\n                // SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission not granted...\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}Run your app #To run your app, you need to first start the development server. To do this, simply run the following command in your root folder:$ npm startNow build and run your Android app as normal (./gradlew installDebug from command-line; in Android Studio just create debug build as usual).If you are using Android Studio for your builds and not the Gradle Wrapper directly, make sure you install watchman before running npm start. It will prevent the packager from crashing due to conflicts between Android Studio and the React Native packager.Once you reach your React-powered activity inside the app, it should load the JavaScript code from the development server and display:\n\n\n\nCreating a release build in Android Studio #You can use Android Studio to create your release builds too! It’s as easy as creating release builds of your previously-existing native Android app. There’s just one additional step, which you’ll have to do before every release build. You need to execute the following to create a React Native bundle, which’ll be included with your native Android app:$ react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.android.js --bundle-output android/com/your-company-name/app-package-name/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/com/your-company-name/app-package-name/src/main/res/Don’t forget to replace the paths with correct ones and create the assets folder if it doesn’t exist!Now just create a release build of your native app from within Android Studio as usual and you should be good to go!← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Colors","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/colors.html","content":"Colors #The following formats are supported:'#f0f' (#rgb)'#f0fc' (#rgba)'#ff00ff' (#rrggbb)'#ff00ff00' (#rrggbbaa)'rgb(255, 255, 255)''rgba(255, 255, 255, 1.0)''hsl(360, 100%, 100%)''hsla(360, 100%, 100%, 1.0)''transparent''red'0xff00ff00 (0xrrggbbaa)For the named colors, React Native follows the CSS3 specification: aliceblue (#f0f8ff) antiquewhite (#faebd7) aqua (#00ffff) aquamarine (#7fffd4) azure (#f0ffff) beige (#f5f5dc) bisque (#ffe4c4) black (#000000) blanchedalmond (#ffebcd) blue (#0000ff) blueviolet (#8a2be2) brown (#a52a2a) burlywood (#deb887) cadetblue (#5f9ea0) chartreuse (#7fff00) chocolate (#d2691e) coral (#ff7f50) cornflowerblue (#6495ed) cornsilk (#fff8dc) crimson (#dc143c) cyan (#00ffff) darkblue (#00008b) darkcyan (#008b8b) darkgoldenrod (#b8860b) darkgray (#a9a9a9) darkgreen (#006400) darkgrey (#a9a9a9) darkkhaki (#bdb76b) darkmagenta (#8b008b) darkolivegreen (#556b2f) darkorange (#ff8c00) darkorchid (#9932cc) darkred (#8b0000) darksalmon (#e9967a) darkseagreen (#8fbc8f) darkslateblue (#483d8b) darkslategray (#2f4f4f) darkslategrey (#2f4f4f) darkturquoise (#00ced1) darkviolet (#9400d3) deeppink (#ff1493) deepskyblue (#00bfff) dimgray (#696969) dimgrey (#696969) dodgerblue (#1e90ff) firebrick (#b22222) floralwhite (#fffaf0) forestgreen (#228b22) fuchsia (#ff00ff) gainsboro (#dcdcdc) ghostwhite (#f8f8ff) gold (#ffd700) goldenrod (#daa520) gray (#808080) green (#008000) greenyellow (#adff2f) grey (#808080) honeydew (#f0fff0) hotpink (#ff69b4) indianred (#cd5c5c) indigo (#4b0082) ivory (#fffff0) khaki (#f0e68c) lavender (#e6e6fa) lavenderblush (#fff0f5) lawngreen (#7cfc00) lemonchiffon (#fffacd) lightblue (#add8e6) lightcoral (#f08080) lightcyan (#e0ffff) lightgoldenrodyellow (#fafad2) lightgray (#d3d3d3) lightgreen (#90ee90) lightgrey (#d3d3d3) lightpink (#ffb6c1) lightsalmon (#ffa07a) lightseagreen (#20b2aa) lightskyblue (#87cefa) lightslategray (#778899) lightslategrey (#778899) lightsteelblue (#b0c4de) lightyellow (#ffffe0) lime (#00ff00) limegreen (#32cd32) linen (#faf0e6) magenta (#ff00ff) maroon (#800000) mediumaquamarine (#66cdaa) mediumblue (#0000cd) mediumorchid (#ba55d3) mediumpurple (#9370db) mediumseagreen (#3cb371) mediumslateblue (#7b68ee) mediumspringgreen (#00fa9a) mediumturquoise (#48d1cc) mediumvioletred (#c71585) midnightblue (#191970) mintcream (#f5fffa) mistyrose (#ffe4e1) moccasin (#ffe4b5) navajowhite (#ffdead) navy (#000080) oldlace (#fdf5e6) olive (#808000) olivedrab (#6b8e23) orange (#ffa500) orangered (#ff4500) orchid (#da70d6) palegoldenrod (#eee8aa) palegreen (#98fb98) paleturquoise (#afeeee) palevioletred (#db7093) papayawhip (#ffefd5) peachpuff (#ffdab9) peru (#cd853f) pink (#ffc0cb) plum (#dda0dd) powderblue (#b0e0e6) purple (#800080) rebeccapurple (#663399) red (#ff0000) rosybrown (#bc8f8f) royalblue (#4169e1) saddlebrown (#8b4513) salmon (#fa8072) sandybrown (#f4a460) seagreen (#2e8b57) seashell (#fff5ee) sienna (#a0522d) silver (#c0c0c0) skyblue (#87ceeb) slateblue (#6a5acd) slategray (#708090) slategrey (#708090) snow (#fffafa) springgreen (#00ff7f) steelblue (#4682b4) tan (#d2b48c) teal (#008080) thistle (#d8bfd8) tomato (#ff6347) turquoise (#40e0d0) violet (#ee82ee) wheat (#f5deb3) white (#ffffff) whitesmoke (#f5f5f5) yellow (#ffff00) yellowgreen (#9acd32)← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Images","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/images.html","content":"Images #Static Image Resources #React Native provides a unified way of managing images and other media assets in your iOS and Android apps. To add a static image to your app, place it somewhere in your source code tree and reference it like this:<Image source={require('./my-icon.png')} />The image name is resolved the same way JS modules are resolved. In the example above, the packager will look for my-icon.png in the same folder as the component that requires it. Also, if you have my-icon.ios.png and my-icon.android.png, the packager will pick the correct file for the platform.You can also use the @2x and @3x suffixes to provide images for different screen densities. If you have the following file structure:.\n├── button.js\n└── img\n    ├── check@2x.png\n    └── check@3x.png...and button.js code contains:<Image source={require('./img/check.png')} />...the packager will bundle and serve the image corresponding to device's screen density. For example, check@2x.png, will be used on an iPhone 7, whilecheck@3x.png will be used on an iPhone 7 Plus or a Nexus 5. If there is no image matching the screen density, the closest best option will be selected.On Windows, you might need to restart the packager if you add new images to your project.Here are some benefits that you get:Same system on iOS and Android.Images live in the same folder as your JavaScript code. Components are self-contained.No global namespace, i.e. you don't have to worry about name collisions.Only the images that are actually used will be packaged into your app.Adding and changing images doesn't require app recompilation, just refresh the simulator as you normally do.The packager knows the image dimensions, no need to duplicate it in the code.Images can be distributed via npm packages.In order for this to work, the image name in require has to be known statically.// GOOD\n<Image source={require('./my-icon.png')} />\n\n// BAD\nvar icon = this.props.active ? 'my-icon-active' : 'my-icon-inactive';\n<Image source={require('./' + icon + '.png')} />\n\n// GOOD\nvar icon = this.props.active ? require('./my-icon-active.png') : require('./my-icon-inactive.png');\n<Image source={icon} />Note that image sources required this way include size (width, height) info for the Image. If you need to scale the image dynamically (i.e. via flex), you may need to manually set { width: undefined, height: undefined } on the style attribute.Static Non-Image Resources #The require syntax described above can be used to statically include audio, video or document files in your project as well. Most common file types are supported including .mp3, .wav, .mp4, .mov, .html and .pdf (see the packager defaults file for the full list).A caveat is that videos must use absolute positioning instead of flexGrow, since size info is not currently passed for non-image assets. This limitation doesn't occur for videos that are linked directly into Xcode or the Assets folder for Android.Images From Hybrid App's Resources #If you are building a hybrid app (some UIs in React Native, some UIs in platform code) you can still use images that are already bundled into the app (via Xcode asset catalogs or Android drawable folder):<Image source={{uri: 'app_icon'}} style={{width: 40, height: 40}} />This approach provides no safety checks. It's up to you to guarantee that those images are available in the application. Also you have to specify image dimensions manually.Network Images #Many of the images you will display in your app will not be available at compile time, or you will want to load some dynamically to keep the binary size down. Unlike with static resources, you will need to manually specify the dimensions of your image. It's highly recommended that you use https as well in order to satisfy App Transport Security requirements on iOS.// GOOD\n<Image source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}}\n       style={{width: 400, height: 400}} />\n\n// BAD\n<Image source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} />Cache Control (iOS Only) #In some cases you might only want to display an image if it is already in the local cache, i.e. a low resolution placeholder until a higher resolution is available. In other cases you do not care if the image is outdated and are willing to display an outdated image to save bandwidth. The cache source property gives you control over how the network layer interacts with the cache.default: Use the native platforms default strategy.reload: The data for the URL will be loaded from the originating source.\nNo existing cache data should be used to satisfy a URL load request.force-cache: The existing cached data will be used to satisfy the request,\nregardless of its age or expiration date. If there is no existing data in the cache\ncorresponding the request, the data is loaded from the originating source.only-if-cached: The existing cache data will be used to satisfy a request, regardless of\nits age or expiration date. If there is no existing data in the cache corresponding\nto a URL load request, no attempt is made to load the data from the originating source,\nand the load is considered to have failed.<Image source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png', cache: 'only-if-cached'}}\n       style={{width: 400, height: 400}} />\n`Local Filesystem Images #See CameraRoll for an example of\nusing local resources that are outside of Images.xcassets.Best Camera Roll Image #iOS saves multiple sizes for the same image in your Camera Roll, it is very important to pick the one that's as close as possible for performance reasons. You wouldn't want to use the full quality 3264x2448 image as source when displaying a 200x200 thumbnail. If there's an exact match, React Native will pick it, otherwise it's going to use the first one that's at least 50% bigger in order to avoid blur when resizing from a close size. All of this is done by default so you don't have to worry about writing the tedious (and error prone) code to do it yourself.Why Not Automatically Size Everything? #In the browser if you don't give a size to an image, the browser is going to render a 0x0 element, download the image, and then render the image based with the correct size. The big issue with this behavior is that your UI is going to jump all around as images load, this makes for a very bad user experience.In React Native this behavior is intentionally not implemented. It is more work for the developer to know the dimensions (or aspect ratio) of the remote image in advance, but we believe that it leads to a better user experience. Static images loaded from the app bundle via the require('./my-icon.png') syntax can be automatically sized because their dimensions are available immediately at the time of mounting.For example, the result of require('./my-icon.png') might be:{\"__packager_asset\":true,\"uri\":\"my-icon.png\",\"width\":591,\"height\":573}Source as an object #In React Native, one interesting decision is that the src attribute is named source and doesn't take a string but an object with a uri attribute.<Image source={{uri: 'something.jpg'}} />On the infrastructure side, the reason is that it allows us to attach metadata to this object. For example if you are using require('./my-icon.png'), then we add information about its actual location and size (don't rely on this fact, it might change in the future!). This is also future proofing, for example we may want to support sprites at some point, instead of outputting {uri: ...}, we can output {uri: ..., crop: {left: 10, top: 50, width: 20, height: 40}} and transparently support spriting on all the existing call sites.On the user side, this lets you annotate the object with useful attributes such as the dimension of the image in order to compute the size it's going to be displayed in. Feel free to use it as your data structure to store more information about your image.Background Image via Nesting #A common feature request from developers familiar with the web is background-image. To handle this use case, simply create a normal <Image> component and add whatever children to it you would like to layer on top of it.return (\n  <Image source={...}>\n    <Text>Inside</Text>\n  </Image>\n);iOS Border Radius Styles #Please note that the following corner specific, border radius style properties are currently ignored by iOS's image component:borderTopLeftRadiusborderTopRightRadiusborderBottomLeftRadiusborderBottomRightRadiusOff-thread Decoding #Image decoding can take more than a frame-worth of time. This is one of the major sources of frame drops on the web because decoding is done in the main thread. In React Native, image decoding is done in a different thread. In practice, you already need to handle the case when the image is not downloaded yet, so displaying the placeholder for a few more frames while it is decoding does not require any code change.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Handling Touches","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/handling-touches.html","content":"Handling Touches #Users interact with mobile apps mainly through touch. They can use a combination of gestures, such as tapping on a button, scrolling a list, or zooming on a map.React Native provides components to handle common gestures, such as taps and swipes, as well as a comprehensive gesture responder system to allow for more advanced gesture recognition.Tappable Components #You can use \"Touchable\" components when you want to capture a tapping gesture. They take a function through the onPress props which will be called when the touch begins and ends within the bounds of the component.Example:class MyButton extends Component {\n  _onPressButton() {\n    console.log(\"You tapped the button!\");\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onPressButton}>\n        <Text>Button</Text>\n      </TouchableHighlight>\n    );\n  }\n}Tappable components should provide feedback that show the user what is handling their touch, and what will happen when they lift their finger. The user should also be able to cancel a tap by dragging their finger away.Which component you use will depend on what kind of feedback you want to provide:Generally, you can use TouchableHighlight anywhere you would use a button or link on web. The view's background will be darkened when the user presses down on the button.You may consider using TouchableNativeFeedback on Android to display ink surface reaction ripples that respond to the user's touch.TouchableOpacity can be used to provide feedback by reducing the opacity of the button, allowing the background to be seen through while the user is pressing down.If you need to handle a tap gesture but you don't want any feedback to be displayed, use TouchableWithoutFeedback.Long presses #In some cases, you may want to detect when a user presses and holds a view for a set amount of time. These long presses can be handled by passing a function to the onLongPress props of any of the touchable components listed above.Scrolling lists and swiping views #A common pattern to many mobile apps is the scrollable list of items. Users interact with these using panning or swiping gestures. The ScrollView component displays a list of items that can be scrolled using these gestures.ScrollViews can scroll vertically or horizontally, and can be configured to allow paging through views using swiping gestures by using the pagingEnabled props. Swiping horizontally between views can also be implemented on Android using the ViewPagerAndroid component.A ListView is a special kind of ScrollView that is best suited for displaying long vertical lists of items. It can also display section headers and footers, similar to UITableViews on iOS.Pinch-to-zoom #A ScrollView with a single item can be used to allow the user to zoom content. Set up the maximumZoomScale and minimumZoomScale props and your user will be able to use pinch and expand gestures to zoom in and out.Handling additional gestures #If you want to allow a user to drag a view around the screen, or you want to implement your own custom pan/drag gesture, take a look at the PanResponder API or the gesture responder system docs.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Animations","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html","content":"Animations #Animations are very important to create a great user experience.\nStationary objects must overcome inertia as they start moving.\nObjects in motion have momentum and rarely come to a stop immediately.\nAnimations allow you to convey physically believable motion in your interface.React Native provides two complementary animation systems:\nAnimated for granular and interactive control of specific values, and\nLayoutAnimation for animated global layout transactions.Animated API #The Animated API is designed to make it very easy to concisely express a wide variety of interesting animation and interaction patterns in a very performant way.\nAnimated focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and simple start/stop methods to control time-based animation execution.Animated exports four animatable component types: View, Text, Image, and ScrollView, but you can also create your own using Animated.createAnimatedComponent().For example, a container view that fades in when it is mounted may look like this:// FadeInView.js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  Animated,\n} from 'react-native';\n\nclass FadeInView extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0),          // Initial value for opacity: 0\n    };\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    Animated.timing(                            // Animate over time\n      this.state.fadeAnim,                      // The animated value to drive\n      {\n        toValue: 1,                             // Animate to opacity: 1, or fully opaque\n      }\n    ).start();                                  // Starts the animation\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Animated.View                            // Special animatable View\n        style={{\n          ...this.props.style,\n          opacity: this.state.fadeAnim,          // Bind opacity to animated value\n        }}\n      >\n        {this.props.children}\n      </Animated.View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = FadeInView;You can then use your FadeInView in place of a View in your components, like so:render() {\n  return (\n    <FadeInView style={{width: 250, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}}>\n      <Text style={{fontSize: 28, textAlign: 'center', margin: 10}}>Fading in</Text>\n    </FadeInView>\n  )\n}Let's break down what's happening here.\nIn the FadeInView constructor, a new Animated.Value called fadeAnim is initialized as part of state.\nThe opacity property on the View is mapped to this animated value.\nBehind the scenes, the numeric value is extracted and used to set opacity.When the component mounts, the opacity is set to 0.\nThen, an easing animation is started on the fadeAnim animated value,\nwhich will update all of its dependent mappings (in this case, just the opacity) on each frame as the value animates to the final value of 1.This is done in an optimized way that is faster than calling setState and re-rendering.Because the entire configuration is declarative, we will be able to implement further optimizations that serialize the configuration and runs the animation on a high-priority thread.Configuring animations #Animations are heavily configurable. Custom and predefined easing functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.Animated provides several animation types, the most commonly used one being Animated.timing().\nIt supports animating a value over time using one of various predefined easing functions, or you can use your own.\nEasing functions are typically used in animation to convey gradual acceleration and deceleration of objects.By default, timing will use a easeInOut curve that conveys gradual acceleration to full speed and concludes by gradually decelerating to a stop.\nYou can specify a different easing function by passing a easing parameter.\nCustom duration or even a delay before the animation starts is also supported.For example, if we want to create a 2-second long animation of an object that slightly backs up before moving to its final position:Animated.timing(\n  this.state.xPosition,\n  {\n    toValue: 100,\n    easing: Easing.back,\n    duration: 2000,\n  }                              \n).start();Take a look at the Configuring animations section of the Animated API reference to learn more about all the config parameters supported by the built-in animations.Composing animations #Animations can be combined and played in sequence or in parallel.\nSequential animations can play immediately after the previous animation has finished,\nor they can start after a specified delay.\nThe Animated API provides several methods, such as sequence() and delay(),\neach of which simply take an array of animations to execute and automatically calls start()/stop() as needed.For example, the following animation coasts to a stop, then it springs back while twirling in parallel:Animated.sequence([            // decay, then spring to start and twirl\n  Animated.decay(position, {   // coast to a stop\n    velocity: {x: gestureState.vx, y: gestureState.vy}, // velocity from gesture release\n    deceleration: 0.997,\n  }),\n  Animated.parallel([          // after decay, in parallel:\n    Animated.spring(position, {\n      toValue: {x: 0, y: 0}    // return to start\n    }),\n    Animated.timing(twirl, {   // and twirl\n      toValue: 360,\n    }),\n  ]),\n]).start();                    // start the sequence groupIf one animation is stopped or interrupted, then all other animations in the group are also stopped.\nAnimated.parallel has a stopTogether option that can be set to false to disable this.You can find a full list of composition methods in the Composing animations section of the Animated API reference.Combining animated values #You can combine two animated values via addition, multiplication, division, or modulo to make a new animated value.There are some cases where an animated value needs to invert another animated value for calculation.\nAn example is inverting a scale (2x --> 0.5x):const a = Animated.Value(1);\nconst b = Animated.divide(1, a);\n\nAnimated.spring(a, {\n  toValue: 2,\n}).start();Interpolation #Each property can be run through an interpolation first.\nAn interpolation maps input ranges to output ranges,\ntypically using a linear interpolation but also supports easing functions.\nBy default, it will extrapolate the curve beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.A simple mapping to convert a 0-1 range to a 0-100 range would be:value.interpolate({\n  inputRange: [0, 1],\n  outputRange: [0, 100],\n});For example, you may want to think about your Animated.Value as going from 0 to 1,\nbut animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to 1.\nThis can easily be done by modifying style from the example above like so:  style={{\n    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n    transform: [{\n      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n        inputRange: [0, 1],\n        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n      }),\n    }],\n  }}interpolate() supports multiple range segments as well, which is handy for defining dead zones and other handy tricks.\nFor example, to get an negation relationship at -300 that goes to 0 at -100, then back up to 1 at 0, and then back down to zero at 100 followed by a dead-zone that remains at 0 for everything beyond that, you could do:value.interpolate({\n  inputRange: [-300, -100, 0, 100, 101],\n  outputRange: [300,    0, 1,   0,   0],\n});Which would map like so:Input | Output\n------|-------\n  -400|    450\n  -300|    300\n  -200|    150\n  -100|      0\n   -50|    0.5\n     0|      1\n    50|    0.5\n   100|      0\n   101|      0\n   200|      0interpolate() also supports mapping to strings, allowing you to animate colors as well as values with units. For example, if you wanted to animate a rotation you could do:value.interpolate({\n  inputRange: [0, 360],\n  outputRange: ['0deg', '360deg']\n})interpolate() also supports arbitrary easing functions, many of which are already implemented in the\nEasing module.\ninterpolate() also has configurable behavior for extrapolating the outputRange.\nYou can set the extrapolation by setting the extrapolate, extrapolateLeft, or extrapolateRight options.\nThe default value is extend but you can use clamp to prevent the output value from exceeding outputRange.Tracking dynamic values #Animated values can also track other values.\nJust set the toValue of an animation to another animated value instead of a plain number.\nFor example, a \"Chat Heads\" animation like the one used by Messenger on Android could be implemented with a spring() pinned on another animated value, or with timing() and a duration of 0 for rigid tracking.\nThey can also be composed with interpolations:Animated.spring(follower, {toValue: leader}).start();\nAnimated.timing(opacity, {\n  toValue: pan.x.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 300],\n    outputRange: [1, 0],\n  }),\n}).start();The leader and follower animated values would be implemented using Animated.ValueXY().\nValueXY is a handy way to deal with 2D interactions, such as panning or dragging.\nIt is a simple wrapper that basically contains two Animated.Value instances and some helper functions that call through to them,\nmaking ValueXY a drop-in replacement for Value in many cases.\nIt allows us to track both x and y values in the example above.Tracking gestures #Gestures, like panning or scrolling, and other events can map directly to animated values using Animated.event.\nThis is done with a structured map syntax so that values can be extracted from complex event objects.\nThe first level is an array to allow mapping across multiple args, and that array contains nested objects.For example, when working with horizontal scrolling gestures,\nyou would do the following in order to map event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x to scrollX (an Animated.Value): onScroll={Animated.event(\n   // scrollX = e.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x\n   [{ nativeEvent: {\n        contentOffset: {\n          x: scrollX\n        }\n      }\n    }]\n )}When using PanResponder, you could use the following code to extract the x and y positions from gestureState.dx and gestureState.dy.\nWe use a null in the first position of the array, as we are only interested in the second argument passed to the PanResponder handler,\nwhich is the gestureState.onPanResponderMove={Animated.event(\n  [null, // ignore the native event\n  // extract dx and dy from gestureState\n  // like 'pan.x = gestureState.dx, pan.y = gestureState.dy'\n  {dx: pan.x, dy: pan.y}\n])}Responding to the current animation value #You may notice that there is no obvious way to read the current value while animating.\nThis is because the value may only be known in the native runtime due to optimizations.\nIf you need to run JavaScript in response to the current value, there are two approaches:spring.stopAnimation(callback) will stop the animation and invoke callback with the final value. This is useful when making gesture transitions.spring.addListener(callback) will invoke callback asynchronously while the animation is running, providing a recent value.\nThis is useful for triggering state changes,\nfor example snapping a bobble to a new option as the user drags it closer,\nbecause these larger state changes are less sensitive to a few frames of lag compared to continuous gestures like panning which need to run at 60 fps.Animated is designed to be fully serializable so that animations can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript event loop.\nThis does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\nCheck out Animated.Value.addListener as a way to work around some of these limitations,\nbut use it sparingly since it might have performance implications in the future.Using the native driver #The Animated API is designed to be serializable.\nBy using the native driver,\nwe send everything about the animation to native before starting the animation,\nallowing native code to perform the animation on the UI thread without having to go through the bridge on every frame.\nOnce the animation has started, the JS thread can be blocked without affecting the animation.Using the native driver for normal animations is quite simple.\nJust add useNativeDriver: true to the animation config when starting it.Animated.timing(this.state.animatedValue, {\n  toValue: 1,\n  duration: 500,\n  useNativeDriver: true, // <-- Add this\n}).start();Animated values are only compatible with one driver so if you use native driver when starting an animation on a value,\nmake sure every animation on that value also uses the native driver.The native driver also works with Animated.event.\nThis is specially useful for animations that follow the scroll position as without the native driver,\nthe animation will always run a frame behind the gesture due to the async nature of React Native.<Animated.ScrollView // <-- Use the Animated ScrollView wrapper\n  scrollEventThrottle={1} // <-- Use 1 here to make sure no events are ever missed\n  onScroll={Animated.event(\n    [{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { y: this.state.animatedValue } } }],\n    { useNativeDriver: true } // <-- Add this\n  )}\n>\n  {content}\n</Animated.ScrollView>You can see the native driver in action by running the UIExplorer sample app,\nthen loading the Native Animated Example.\nYou can also take a look at the source code to learn how these examples were produced.Caveats #Not everything you can do with Animated is currently supported by the native driver.\nThe main limitation is that you can only animate non-layout properties:\nthings like transform, opacity and backgroundColor will work, but flexbox and position properties will not.\nWhen using Animated.event, it will only work with direct events and not bubbling events.\nThis means it does not work with PanResponder but does work with things like ScrollView#onScroll.Additional examples #The UIExplorer sample app has various examples of Animated in use:AnimatedGratuitousAppNativeAnimationsExampleLayoutAnimation API #LayoutAnimation allows you to globally configure create and update\nanimations that will be used for all views in the next render/layout cycle.\nThis is useful for doing flexbox layout updates without bothering to measure or\ncalculate specific properties in order to animate them directly, and is\nespecially useful when layout changes may affect ancestors, for example a \"see\nmore\" expansion that also increases the size of the parent and pushes down the\nrow below which would otherwise require explicit coordination between the\ncomponents in order to animate them all in sync.Note that although LayoutAnimation is very powerful and can be quite useful,\nit provides much less control than Animated and other animation libraries, so\nyou may need to use another approach if you can't get LayoutAnimation to do\nwhat you want.Note that in order to get this to work on Android you need to set the following flags via UIManager:UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental && UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);class App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { w: 100, h: 100 };\n    this._onPress = this._onPress.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  componentWillMount() {\n    // Animate creation\n    LayoutAnimation.spring();\n  }\n\n  _onPress() {\n    // Animate the update\n    LayoutAnimation.spring();\n    this.setState({w: this.state.w + 15, h: this.state.h + 15})\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <View style={[styles.box, {width: this.state.w, height: this.state.h}]} />\n        <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._onPress}>\n          <View style={styles.button}>\n            <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Press me!</Text>\n          </View>\n        </TouchableOpacity>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}Run this exampleThis example uses a preset value, you can customize the animations as\nyou need, see LayoutAnimation.js\nfor more information.Additional notes #requestAnimationFrame #requestAnimationFrame is a polyfill from the browser that you might be\nfamiliar with. It accepts a function as its only argument and calls that\nfunction before the next repaint. It is an essential building block for\nanimations that underlies all of the JavaScript-based animation APIs.  In\ngeneral, you shouldn't need to call this yourself - the animation APIs will\nmanage frame updates for you.setNativeProps #As mentioned in the Direction Manipulation section,\nsetNativeProps allows us to modify properties of native-backed\ncomponents (components that are actually backed by native views, unlike\ncomposite components) directly, without having to setState and\nre-render the component hierarchy.We could use this in the Rebound example to update the scale - this\nmight be helpful if the component that we are updating is deeply nested\nand hasn't been optimized with shouldComponentUpdate.// Back inside of the App component, replace the scrollSpring listener\n// in componentWillMount with this:\nthis._scrollSpring.addListener({\n  onSpringUpdate: () => {\n    if (!this._photo) { return }\n    var v = this._scrollSpring.getCurrentValue();\n    var newProps = {style: {transform: [{scaleX: v}, {scaleY: v}]}};\n    this._photo.setNativeProps(newProps);\n  },\n});\n\n// Lastly, we update the render function to no longer pass in the\n// transform via style (avoid clashes when re-rendering) and to set the\n// photo ref\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <TouchableWithoutFeedback onPressIn={this._onPressIn} onPressOut={this._onPressOut}>\n        <Image ref={component => this._photo = component}\n               source={{uri: \"img/ReboundExample.png\"}}\n               style={{width: 250, height: 200}} />\n      </TouchableWithoutFeedback>\n    </View>\n  );\n}Run this exampleIt would not make sense to use setNativeProps with react-tween-state\nbecause the updated tween values are set on the state automatically by\nthe library - Rebound on the other hand gives us an updated value for\neach frame with the onSpringUpdate function.If you find your animations with dropping frames (performing below 60\nframes per second), look into using setNativeProps or\nshouldComponentUpdate to optimize them. You may also want to defer any\ncomputationally intensive work until after animations are complete,\nusing the\nInteractionManager. You\ncan monitor the frame rate by using the In-App Developer Menu \"FPS\nMonitor\" tool.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Accessibility","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility.html","content":"Accessibility #Native App Accessibility (iOS and Android) #Both iOS and Android provide APIs for making apps accessible to people with disabilities. In addition, both platforms provide bundled assistive technologies, like the screen readers VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android) for the visually impaired. Similarly, in React Native we have included APIs designed to provide developers with support for making apps more accessible. Take note, iOS and Android differ slightly in their approaches, and thus the React Native implementations may vary by platform.In addition to this documentation, you might find this blog post about React Native accessibility to be useful.Making Apps Accessible #Accessibility properties #accessible (iOS, Android) #When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element. When a view is an accessibility element, it groups its children into a single selectable component. By default, all touchable elements are accessible.On Android, ‘accessible={true}’ property for a react-native View will be translated into native ‘focusable={true}’.<View accessible={true}>\n  <Text>text one</Text>\n  <Text>text two</Text>\n</View>In the above example, we can't get accessibility focus separately on 'text one' and 'text two'. Instead we get focus on a parent view with 'accessible' property.accessibilityLabel (iOS, Android) #When a view is marked as accessible, it is a good practice to set an accessibilityLabel on the view, so that people who use VoiceOver know what element they have selected. VoiceOver will read this string when a user selects the associated element.To use, set the accessibilityLabel property to a custom string on your View:<TouchableOpacity accessible={true} accessibilityLabel={'Tap me!'} onPress={this._onPress}>\n  <View style={styles.button}>\n    <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Press me!</Text>\n  </View>\n</TouchableOpacity>In the above example, the accessibilityLabel on the TouchableOpacity element would default to \"Press me!\". The label is constructed by concatenating all Text node children separated by spaces.accessibilityTraits (iOS) #Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected. Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.To use, set the accessibilityTraits property to one of (or an array of) accessibility trait strings:none Used when the element has no traits.button Used when the element should be treated as a button.link Used when the element should be treated as a link.header Used when an element acts as a header for a content section (e.g. the title of a navigation bar).search Used when the text field element should also be treated as a search field.image Used when the element should be treated as an image. Can be combined with button or link, for example.selected  Used when the element is selected. For example, a selected row in a table or a selected button within a segmented control.plays Used when the element plays its own sound when activated.key Used when the element acts as a keyboard key.text Used when the element should be treated as static text that cannot change.summary Used when an element can be used to provide a quick summary of current conditions in the app when the app first launches.  For example, when Weather first launches, the element with today's weather conditions is marked with this trait.disabled Used when the control is not enabled and does not respond to user input.frequentUpdates Used when the element frequently updates its label or value, but too often to send notifications. Allows an accessibility client to poll for changes. A stopwatch would be an example.startsMedia Used when activating an element starts a media session (e.g. playing a movie, recording audio) that should not be interrupted by output from an assistive technology, like VoiceOver.adjustable Used when an element can be \"adjusted\" (e.g. a slider).allowsDirectInteraction Used when an element allows direct touch interaction for VoiceOver users (for example, a view representing a piano keyboard).pageTurn Informs VoiceOver that it should scroll to the next page when it finishes reading the contents of the element.accessibilityViewIsModal (iOS) #A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.For example, in a window that contains sibling views A and B, setting accessibilityViewIsModal to true on view B causes VoiceOver to ignore the elements in the view A.\nOn the other hand, if view B contains a child view C and you set accessibilityViewIsModal to true on view C, VoiceOver does not ignore the elements in view A.onAccessibilityTap (iOS) #Use this property to assign a custom function to be called when someone activates an accessible element by double tapping on it while it's selected.onMagicTap (iOS) #Assign this property to a custom function which will be called when someone performs the \"magic tap\" gesture, which is a double-tap with two fingers. A magic tap function should perform the most relevant action a user could take on a component. In the Phone app on iPhone, a magic tap answers a phone call, or ends the current one. If the selected element does not have an onMagicTap function, the system will traverse up the view hierarchy until it finds a view that does.accessibilityComponentType (Android) #In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”). If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.<TouchableWithoutFeedback accessibilityComponentType=”button”\n  onPress={this._onPress}>\n  <View style={styles.button}>\n    <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Press me!</Text>\n  </View>\n</TouchableWithoutFeedback>In the above example, the TouchableWithoutFeedback is being announced by TalkBack as a native Button.accessibilityLiveRegion (Android) #When components dynamically change, we want TalkBack to alert the end user. This is made possible by the ‘accessibilityLiveRegion’ property. It can be set to ‘none’, ‘polite’ and ‘assertive’:none Accessibility services should not announce changes to this view.polite Accessibility services should announce changes to this view.assertive Accessibility services should interrupt ongoing speech to immediately announce changes to this view.<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={this._addOne}>\n  <View style={styles.embedded}>\n    <Text>Click me</Text>\n  </View>\n</TouchableWithoutFeedback>\n<Text accessibilityLiveRegion=\"polite\">\n  Clicked {this.state.count} times\n</Text>In the above example method _addOne changes the state.count variable. As soon as an end user clicks the TouchableWithoutFeedback, TalkBack reads text in the Text view because of its 'accessibilityLiveRegion=”polite”' property.importantForAccessibility (Android) #In the case of two overlapping UI components with the same parent, default accessibility focus can have unpredictable behavior. The ‘importantForAccessibility’ property will resolve this by controlling if a view fires accessibility events and if it is reported to accessibility services. It can be set to ‘auto’, ‘yes’, ‘no’ and ‘no-hide-descendants’ (the last value will force accessibility services to ignore the component and all of its children).<View style={styles.container}>\n  <View style={{position: 'absolute', left: 10, top: 10, right: 10, height: 100,\n    backgroundColor: 'green'}} importantForAccessibility=”yes”>\n    <Text> First layout </Text>\n  </View>\n  <View style={{position: 'absolute', left: 10, top: 10, right: 10, height: 100,\n    backgroundColor: 'yellow'}} importantForAccessibility=”no-hide-descendants”>\n    <Text> Second layout </Text>\n  </View>\n</View>In the above example, the yellow layout and its descendants are completely invisible to TalkBack and all other accessibility services. So we can easily use overlapping views with the same parent without confusing TalkBack.Checking if a Screen Reader is Enabled #The AccessibilityInfo API allows you to determine whether or not a screen reader is currently active. See the AccessibilityInfo documentation for details.Sending Accessibility Events (Android) #Sometimes it is useful to trigger an accessibility event on a UI component (i.e. when a custom view appears on a screen or a custom radio button has been selected). Native UIManager module exposes a method ‘sendAccessibilityEvent’ for this purpose. It takes two arguments: view tag and a type of an event._onPress: function() {\n  this.state.radioButton = this.state.radioButton === “radiobutton_checked” ?\n  “radiobutton_unchecked” : “radiobutton_checked”;\n  if (this.state.radioButton === “radiobutton_checked”) {\n    RCTUIManager.sendAccessibilityEvent(\n      ReactNative.findNodeHandle(this),\n      RCTUIManager.AccessibilityEventTypes.typeViewClicked);\n  }\n}\n\n<CustomRadioButton\n  accessibleComponentType={this.state.radioButton}\n  onPress={this._onPress}/>In the above example we've created a custom radio button that now behaves like a native one. More specifically, TalkBack now correctly announces changes to the radio button selection.Testing VoiceOver Support (iOS) #To enable VoiceOver, go to the Settings app on your iOS device. Tap General, then Accessibility. There you will find many tools that people use to use to make their devices more usable, such as bolder text, increased contrast, and VoiceOver.To enable VoiceOver, tap on VoiceOver under \"Vision\" and toggle the switch that appears at the top.At the very bottom of the Accessibility settings, there is an \"Accessibility Shortcut\". You can use this to toggle VoiceOver by triple clicking the Home button.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Timers","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/timers.html","content":"Timers #Timers are an important part of an application and React Native implements the browser timers.Timers #setTimeout, clearTimeoutsetInterval, clearIntervalsetImmediate, clearImmediaterequestAnimationFrame, cancelAnimationFramerequestAnimationFrame(fn) is not the same as setTimeout(fn, 0) - the former will fire after all the frame has flushed, whereas the latter will fire as quickly as possible (over 1000x per second on a iPhone 5S).setImmediate is executed at the end of the current JavaScript execution block, right before sending the batched response back to native. Note that if you call setImmediate within a setImmediate callback, it will be executed right away, it won't yield back to native in between.The Promise implementation uses setImmediate as its asynchronicity primitive.InteractionManager #One reason why well-built native apps feel so smooth is by avoiding expensive operations during interactions and animations. In React Native, we currently have a limitation that there is only a single JS execution thread, but you can use InteractionManager to make sure long-running work is scheduled to start after any interactions/animations have completed.Applications can schedule tasks to run after interactions with the following:InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {\n   // ...long-running synchronous task...\n});Compare this to other scheduling alternatives:requestAnimationFrame(): for code that animates a view over time.setImmediate/setTimeout/setInterval(): run code later, note this may delay animations.runAfterInteractions(): run code later, without delaying active animations.The touch handling system considers one or more active touches to be an 'interaction' and will delay runAfterInteractions() callbacks until all touches have ended or been cancelled.InteractionManager also allows applications to register animations by creating an interaction 'handle' on animation start, and clearing it upon completion:var handle = InteractionManager.createInteractionHandle();\n// run animation...

To solve this recurring issue, we introduced TimerMixin. If you include TimerMixin, then you can replace your calls to setTimeout(fn, 500) with this.setTimeout(fn, 500) (just prepend this.) and everything will be properly cleaned up for you when the component unmounts.This library does not ship with React Native - in order to use it on your project, you will need to install it with npm i react-timer-mixin --save from your project directory.import TimerMixin from 'react-timer-mixin';\n\nvar Component = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [TimerMixin],\n  componentDidMount: function() {\n    this.setTimeout(\n      () => { console.log('I do not leak!'); },\n      500\n    );\n  }\n});This will eliminate a lot of hard work tracking down bugs, such as crashes caused by timeouts firing after a component has been unmounted.Keep in mind that if you use ES6 classes for your React components there is no built-in API for mixins. To use TimerMixin with ES6 classes, we recommend react-mixin.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Direct Manipulation","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/direct-manipulation.html","content":"Direct Manipulation #It is sometimes necessary to make changes directly to a component\nwithout using state/props to trigger a re-render of the entire subtree.\nWhen using React in the browser for example, you sometimes need to\ndirectly modify a DOM node, and the same is true for views in mobile\napps. setNativeProps is the React Native equivalent to setting\nproperties directly on a DOM node.Use setNativeProps when frequent re-rendering creates a performance bottleneckDirect manipulation will not be a tool that you reach for\nfrequently; you will typically only be using it for creating\ncontinuous animations to avoid the overhead of rendering the component\nhierarchy and reconciling many views. setNativeProps is imperative\nand stores state in the native layer (DOM, UIView, etc.) and not\nwithin your React components, which makes your code more difficult to\nreason about. Before you use it, try to solve your problem with setState\nand shouldComponentUpdate.setNativeProps with TouchableOpacity #TouchableOpacity\nuses setNativeProps internally to update the opacity of its child\ncomponent:setOpacityTo(value) {\n  // Redacted: animation related code\n  this.refs[CHILD_REF].setNativeProps({\n    opacity: value\n  });\n},This allows us to write the following code and know that the child will\nhave its opacity updated in response to taps, without the child having\nany knowledge of that fact or requiring any changes to its implementation:<TouchableOpacity onPress={this._handlePress}>\n  <View style={styles.button}>\n    <Text>Press me!</Text>\n  </View>\n</TouchableOpacity>Let's imagine that setNativeProps was not available. One way that we\nmight implement it with that constraint is to store the opacity value\nin the state, then update that value whenever onPress is fired:constructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = { myButtonOpacity: 1, };\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this.setState({myButtonOpacity: 0.5})}\n                      onPressOut={() => this.setState({myButtonOpacity: 1})}>\n      <View style={[styles.button, {opacity: this.state.myButtonOpacity}]}>\n        <Text>Press me!</Text>\n      </View>\n    </TouchableOpacity>\n  )\n}This is computationally intensive compared to the original example -\nReact needs to re-render the component hierarchy each time the opacity\nchanges, even though other properties of the view and its children\nhaven't changed. Usually this overhead isn't a concern but when\nperforming continuous animations and responding to gestures, judiciously\noptimizing your components can improve your animations' fidelity.If you look at the implementation of setNativeProps in\nNativeMethodsMixin.js\nyou will notice that it is a wrapper around RCTUIManager.updateView -\nthis is the exact same function call that results from re-rendering -\nsee receiveComponent in\nReactNativeBaseComponent.js.Composite components and setNativeProps #Composite components are not backed by a native view, so you cannot call\nsetNativeProps on them. Consider this example:class MyButton extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <Text>{this.props.label}</Text>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <TouchableOpacity>\n        <MyButton label=\"Press me!\" />\n      </TouchableOpacity>\n    )\n  }\n}Run this exampleIf you run this you will immediately see this error: Touchable child\nmust either be native or forward setNativeProps to a native component.\nThis occurs because MyButton isn't directly backed by a native view\nwhose opacity should be set. You can think about it like this: if you\ndefine a component with React.createClass you would not expect to be\nable to set a style prop on it and have that work - you would need to\npass the style prop down to a child, unless you are wrapping a native\ncomponent. Similarly, we are going to forward setNativeProps to a\nnative-backed child component.Forward setNativeProps to a child #All we need to do is provide a setNativeProps method on our component\nthat calls setNativeProps on the appropriate child with the given\narguments.class MyButton extends React.Component {\n  setNativeProps(nativeProps) {\n    this._root.setNativeProps(nativeProps);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View ref={component => this._root = component} {...this.props}>\n        <Text>{this.props.label}</Text>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}Run this exampleYou can now use MyButton inside of TouchableOpacity! A sidenote for\nclarity: we used the ref callback syntax here, rather than the traditional string-based ref.You may have noticed that we passed all of the props down to the child\nview using {...this.props}. The reason for this is that\nTouchableOpacity is actually a composite component, and so in addition\nto depending on setNativeProps on its child, it also requires that the\nchild perform touch handling. To do this, it passes on various\nprops\nthat call back to the TouchableOpacity component.\nTouchableHighlight, in contrast, is backed by a native view and only\nrequires that we implement setNativeProps.setNativeProps to clear TextInput value #Another very common use case of setNativeProps is to clear the value\nof a TextInput. The controlled prop of TextInput can sometimes drop\ncharacters when the bufferDelay is low and the user types very\nquickly. Some developers prefer to skip this prop entirely and instead\nuse setNativeProps to directly manipulate the TextInput value when\nnecessary. For example, the following code demonstrates clearing the\ninput when you tap a button:class App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.clearText = this.clearText.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  clearText() {\n    this._textInput.setNativeProps({text: ''});\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <TextInput ref={component => this._textInput = component}\n                   style={styles.textInput} />\n        <TouchableOpacity onPress={this.clearText}>\n          <Text>Clear text</Text>\n        </TouchableOpacity>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}Run this exampleAvoiding conflicts with the render function #If you update a property that is also managed by the render function,\nyou might end up with some unpredictable and confusing bugs because\nanytime the component re-renders and that property changes, whatever\nvalue was previously set from setNativeProps will be completely\nignored and overridden. See this example\nfor a demonstration of what can happen if these two collide - notice\nthe jerky animation each 250ms when setState triggers a re-render.setNativeProps & shouldComponentUpdate #By intelligently applying\nshouldComponentUpdate\nyou can avoid the unnecessary overhead involved in reconciling unchanged\ncomponent subtrees, to the point where it may be performant enough to\nuse setState instead of setNativeProps.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Debugging","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html","content":"Debugging #Accessing the In-App Developer Menu #You can access the developer menu by shaking your device or by selecting \"Shake Gesture\" inside the Hardware menu in the iOS Simulator.

See Prerequisites.You also need to install the Buck build tool.We recommend running the Android integration tests in an emulator, although you can also use a real Android device. It's a good idea to keep the emulator running with a visible window.

The two main components are RCTTestRunner and RCTTestModule.  RCTTestRunner sets up the ReactNative environment and provides facilities to run the tests as XCTestCases in Xcode (runTest:module is the simplest method).  RCTTestModule is exported to JS as NativeModules.TestModule.  The tests themselves are written in JS, and must call TestModule.markTestCompleted() when they are done, otherwise the test will timeout and fail.  Test failures are primarily indicated by throwing a JS exception.  It is also possible to test error conditions with runTest:module:initialProps:expectErrorRegex: or runTest:module:initialProps:expectErrorBlock: which will expect an error to be thrown and verify the error matches the provided criteria.  See the following for example usage and integration points:IntegrationTestHarnessTest.jsUIExplorerIntegrationTests.mIntegrationTestsApp.jsYou can run integration tests locally with cmd+U in the IntegrationTest and UIExplorer apps in Xcode, or by running the following in the command line on macOS:$ cd react-native\n$ ./scripts/objc-test-ios.shYour Xcode install will come with a variety of Simulators running the latest OS. You may need to manually create a new Simulator to match what the XCODE_DESTINATION param in the test script.Screenshot/Snapshot Tests #A common type of integration test is the snapshot test.  These tests render a component, and verify snapshots of the screen against reference images using TestModule.verifySnapshot(), using the FBSnapshotTestCase library behind the scenes.  Reference images are recorded by setting recordMode = YES on the RCTTestRunner, then running the tests.  Snapshots will differ slightly between 32 and 64 bit, and various OS versions, so it's recommended that you enforce tests are run with the correct configuration.  It's also highly recommended that all network data be mocked out, along with other potentially troublesome dependencies.  See SimpleSnapshotTest for a basic example.If you make a change that affects a snapshot test in a PR, such as adding a new example case to one of the examples that is snapshotted, you'll need to re-record the snapshot reference image.  To do this, simply change to _runner.recordMode = YES; in UIExplorer/UIExplorerSnapshotTests.m, re-run the failing tests, then flip record back to NO and submit/update your PR and wait to see if the Travis build passes.End-to-end tests #Finally, make sure end-to-end tests run successfully by executing the following script:$ cd react-native\n$ ./scripts/test-manual-e2e.shWebsite #The React Native website is hosted on GitHub pages and is automatically generated from Markdown sources as well as comments in the JavaScript source files.

To do this, go to Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme (cmd + <), make sure you're in the Run tab from the side, and set the Build Configuration dropdown to Release.Apps built for Release will automatically disable the in-app Developer menu, which will prevent your users from inadvertently accessing the menu in production. It will also load the JavaScript locally, so you can put the app on a device and test whilst not connected to the computer.HintYou can also use the React Native CLI to perform this operation using the option --configuration with the value Release (e.g. react-native run-ios --configuration Release).Once built for release, you'll be able to distribute the app to beta testers and submit the app to the App Store.App Transport Security #App Transport Security is a security feature, added in iOS 9, that rejects all HTTP requests that are not sent over HTTPS.

Check Babel documentation on its supported transformations for more details.Here's a full list of React Native's enabled transformations.ES5Reserved Words: promise.catch(function() { });ES6Arrow functions: <C onPress={() => this.setState({pressed: true})}Block scoping: let greeting = 'hi';Call spread: Math.max(...array);Classes: class C extends React.Component { render() { return <View />; } }Constants: const answer = 42;Destructuring: var {isActive, style} = this.props;for...of: for (var num of [1, 2, 3]) {}Modules: import React, { Component } from 'react';Computed Properties: var key = 'abc'; var obj = {[key]: 10};Object Concise Method: var obj = { method() { return 10; } };Object Short Notation: var name = 'vjeux'; var obj = { name };Rest Params: function(type, ...args) { }Template Literals: var who = 'world'; var str = `Hello ${who}`;ES7Object Spread: var extended = { ...obj, a: 10 };Function Trailing Comma: function f(a, b, c,) { }Async Functions: async function doStuffAsync() { const foo = await doOtherStuffAsync(); };SpecificJSX: <View style={{color: 'red'}} />Flow: function foo(x: ?number): string {}Polyfills #Many standards functions are also available on all the supported JavaScript runtimes.Browserconsole.{log, warn, error, info, trace, table}CommonJS requireXMLHttpRequest, fetch{set, clear}{Timeout, Interval, Immediate}, {request, cancel}AnimationFramenavigator.geolocationES6Object.assignString.prototype.{startsWith, endsWith, repeat, includes}Array.fromArray.prototype.{find, findIndex, includes}ES7Object.{entries, values}Specific__DEV__← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Navigation","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html","content":"Navigation #This guide covers the various navigation components available in React Native. If you are just getting started with navigation, you will probably want to use React Navigation.If you are only targeting iOS and would like to stick to the native look and feel, check out NavigatorIOS. The Navigator component is older but has been thoroughly tested in production.React Navigation #The community solution to navigation is a standalone library that allows developers to set up the screens of an app with just a few lines of code.The first step is to install in your app:npm install --save react-navigationThen you can quickly create an app with a home screen and a profile screen:import {\n  StackNavigator,\n} from 'react-navigation';\n\nconst App = StackNavigator({\n  Main: {screen: MainScreen},\n  Profile: {screen: ProfileScreen},\n});Each screen component can set navigation options such as the header title. It can use action creators on the navigation prop to link to other screens:class MainScreen extends React.Component {\n  static navigationOptions = {\n    title: 'Welcome',\n  };\n  render() {\n    const { navigate } = this.props.navigation;\n    return (\n      <Button\n        title=\"Go to Jane's profile\"\n        onPress={() =>\n          navigate('Profile', { name: 'Jane' });\n        }\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}React Navigation routers make it easy to override navigation logic or integrate it into redux. Because routers can be nested inside eachother, developers can override navigation logic for one area of the app without making widespread changes.The views in React Navigation use native components and the Animated library to deliver 60fps animations that are run on the native thread. Plus, the animations and gestures can be easily customized.For a complete intro to React Navigation, follow the getting started guide, or browse other docs such as the intro to navigators.Navigator #Like React Navigation, Navigator provides a JavaScript implementation of a navigation stack, so it works on both iOS and Android and is easy to customize. Navigator was released alongside React Native in 2015, so it predates the Animated library with native-thread animations.Navigator can be adapted to render different components based on the current route in its renderScene function. It will transition new scenes onto the screen by sliding in from the right by default, but you can control this behavior by using the configureScene function. You can also configure a navigation bar through the navigationBar prop.Check out the Navigator API reference for specific examples that cover each of these scenarios.NavigatorIOS #If you are targeting iOS only, you may also want to consider using NavigatorIOS. It looks and feels just like UINavigationController, because it is actually built on top of it.<NavigatorIOS\n  initialRoute={{\n    component: MyScene,\n    title: 'My Initial Scene',\n    passProps: { myProp: 'foo' },\n  }}\n/>Like other navigation systems, NavigatorIOS uses routes to represent screens, with some important differences. The actual component that will be rendered can be specified using the component key in the route, and any props that should be passed to this component can be specified in passProps. A \"navigator\" object is automatically passed as a prop to the component, allowing you to call push and pop as needed.As NavigatorIOS leverages native UIKit navigation, it will automatically render a navigation bar with a back button and title.import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport { NavigatorIOS, Text, TouchableHighlight, View } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class NavigatorIOSApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <NavigatorIOS\n        initialRoute={{\n          component: MyScene,\n          title: 'My Initial Scene',\n        }}\n        style={{flex: 1}}\n      />\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyScene extends Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n    navigator: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n  }\n\n  constructor(props, context) {\n    super(props, context);\n    this._onForward = this._onForward.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  _onForward() {\n    this.props.navigator.push({\n      title: 'Scene ' + nextIndex,\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <Text>Current Scene: { this.props.title }</Text>\n        <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onForward}>\n          <Text>Tap me to load the next scene</Text>\n        </TouchableHighlight>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}Check out the NavigatorIOS reference docs to learn more about this component.You may also want to check out react-native-navigation, a component that aims to provide native navigation on both iOS and Android.NavigationExperimental #Since early 2016, React Native has shipped with an experimental re-implementation of the original Navigator component called CardStack. The major benefit it had over Navigator is the smooth native-thread animations provided by the Animated library.Because NavigationExperimental only included view components, it required a lot of boilerplate to use by itself. Several libraries sprung up around it, making it easier to use. Libraries such as react-native-router-flux, ex-navigation, and react-router-native all wrapped NavigationExperimental views in an easier-to-use API. Authors of many of these libraries now support React Navigation.The CardStack and other NavigationExperimental views live on as a part of the React Navigation project. The new library aims to be easy to use, while continuing to enable the smooth and customizable animations that NavigationExperimental pioneered.As of React Native 0.43, NavigationExperimental is deprecated. It will be removed from the codebase in a later version.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Performance","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/performance.html","content":"Performance #A compelling reason for using React Native instead of WebView-based\ntools is to achieve 60 FPS and a native look & feel to your apps. Where\npossible, we would like for React Native to do the right thing and help\nyou to focus on your app instead of performance optimization, but there\nare areas where we're not quite there yet, and others where React Native\n(similar to writing native code directly) cannot possibly determine the\nbest way to optimize for you and so manual intervention will be\nnecessary.This guide is intended to teach you some basics to help you\nto troubleshoot performance issues, as well as discuss common sources of\nproblems and their suggested solutions.What you need to know about frames #Your grandparents' generation called movies \"moving\npictures\" for a reason:\nrealistic motion in video is an illusion created by quickly changing\nstatic images at a consistent speed. We refer to each of these images as\nframes. The number of frames that is displayed each second has a direct\nimpact on how smooth and ultimately life-like a video (or user\ninterface) seems to be. iOS devices display 60 frames per second, which\ngives you and the UI system about 16.67ms to do all of the work needed to\ngenerate the static image (frame) that the user will see on the screen\nfor that interval. If you are unable to do the work necessary to\ngenerate that frame within the allotted 16.67ms, then you will \"drop a\nframe\" and the UI will appear unresponsive.Now to confuse the matter a little bit, open up the developer menu in\nyour app and toggle Show Perf Monitor. You will notice that there are\ntwo different frame rates.JavaScript frame rate #For most React Native applications, your business logic will run on the\nJavaScript thread. This is where your React application lives, API calls\nare made, touch events are processed, etc... Updates to native-backed\nviews are batched and sent over to the native side at the end of each iteration of the event loop, before the frame deadline (if\nall goes well). If the JavaScript thread is unresponsive for a frame, it\nwill be considered a dropped frame. For example, if you were to call\nthis.setState on the root component of a complex application and it\nresulted in re-rendering computationally expensive component subtrees,\nit's conceivable that this might take 200ms and result in 12 frames\nbeing dropped. Any animations controlled by JavaScript would appear to freeze during that time. If anything takes longer than 100ms, the user will feel it.This often happens during Navigator transitions: when you push a new\nroute, the JavaScript thread needs to render all of the components\nnecessary for the scene in order to send over the proper commands to the\nnative side to create the backing views. It's common for the work being\ndone here to take a few frames and cause jank because the transition is\ncontrolled by the JavaScript thread. Sometimes components will do\nadditional work on componentDidMount, which might result in a second\nstutter in the transition.Another example is responding to touches: if you are doing work across\nmultiple frames on the JavaScript thread, you might notice a delay in\nresponding to TouchableOpacity, for example. This is because the JavaScript thread is busy and cannot process the raw touch events sent over from the main thread. As a result, TouchableOpacity cannot react to the touch events and command the native view to adjust its opacity.Main thread (aka UI thread) frame rate #Many people have noticed that performance of NavigatorIOS is better\nout of the box than Navigator. The reason for this is that the\nanimations for the transitions are done entirely on the main thread, and\nso they are not interrupted by frame drops on the JavaScript thread.\n(Read about why you should probably use Navigator\nanyways.Similarly, you can happily scroll up and down through a ScrollView when\nthe JavaScript thread is locked up because the ScrollView lives on the\nmain thread (the scroll events are dispatched to the JS thread though,\nbut their receipt is not necessary for the scroll to occur).Common sources of performance problems #Console.log statements #When running a bundled app, these statements can cause a big bottleneck in the JavaScript thread. This includes calls from debugging libraries such as redux-logger, so make sure to remove them before bundling.Development mode (dev=true) #JavaScript thread performance suffers greatly when running in dev mode.\nThis is unavoidable: a lot more work needs to be done at runtime to\nprovide you with good warnings and error messages, such as validating\npropTypes and various other assertions.Slow navigator transitions #As mentioned above, Navigator animations are controlled by the\nJavaScript thread. Imagine the \"push from right\" scene transition: each\nframe, the new scene is moved from the right to left, starting offscreen\n(let's say at an x-offset of 320) and ultimately settling when the scene sits\nat an x-offset of 0. Each frame during this transition, the\nJavaScript thread needs to send a new x-offset to the main thread.\nIf the JavaScript thread is locked up, it cannot do this and so no\nupdate occurs on that frame and the animation stutters.Part of the long-term solution to this is to allow for JavaScript-based\nanimations to be offloaded to the main thread. If we were to do the same\nthing as in the above example with this approach, we might calculate a\nlist of all x-offsets for the new scene when we are starting the\ntransition and send them to the main thread to execute in an\noptimized way. Now that the JavaScript thread is freed of this\nresponsibility, it's not a big deal if it drops a few frames while\nrendering the scene -- you probably won't even notice because you will be\ntoo distracted by the pretty transition.Unfortunately this solution is not yet implemented, and so in the\nmeantime we should use the InteractionManager to selectively render the\nminimal amount of content necessary for the new scene as long as the\nanimation is in progress. InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions takes\na callback as its only argument, and that callback is fired when the\nnavigator transition is complete (each animation from the Animated API\nalso notifies the InteractionManager, but that's beyond the scope of\nthis discussion).Your scene component might look something like this:class ExpensiveScene extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props, context) {\n    super(props, context);\n    this.state = {renderPlaceholderOnly: true};\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {\n      this.setState({renderPlaceholderOnly: false});\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.renderPlaceholderOnly) {\n      return this._renderPlaceholderView();\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <Text>Your full view goes here</Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n\n\n  _renderPlaceholderView() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <Text>Loading...</Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n};You don't need to be limited to rendering some loading indicator, you\ncould alternatively render part of your content -- for example, when you\nload the Facebook app you see a placeholder news feed item with grey\nrectangles where text will be. If you are rendering a Map in your new\nscene, you might want to display a grey placeholder view or a spinner\nuntil the transition is complete as this can actually cause frames to be\ndropped on the main thread.ListView initial rendering is too slow or scroll performance is bad for large lists #This is an issue that comes up frequently because iOS ships with\nUITableView which gives you very good performance by re-using underlying\nUIViews. Work is in progress to do something similar with React Native,\nbut until then we have some tools at our disposal to help us tweak the\nperformance to suit our needs. It may not be possible to get all the way\nthere, but a little bit of creativity and experimentation with these\noptions can go a long way.initialListSize #This prop specifies how many rows we want to render on our first render\npass. If we are concerned with getting something on screen as quickly\nas possible, we could set the initialListSize to 1, and we'll quickly\nsee other rows fill in on subsequent frames. The number of rows per\nframe is determined by the pageSize.pageSize #After the initial render where initialListSize is used, ListView looks\nat the pageSize to determine how many rows to render per frame. The\ndefault here is 1 -- but if your views are very small and inexpensive to\nrender, you might want to bump this up. Tweak it and find what works for\nyour use case.scrollRenderAheadDistance #\"How early to start rendering rows before they come on screen, in pixels.\"If we had a list with 2000 items and rendered them all immediately that\nwould be a poor use of both memory and computational resources. It would\nalso probably cause some pretty awful jank. So the scrollRenderAhead\ndistance allows us to specify how far beyond the current viewport we\nshould continue to render rows.removeClippedSubviews #\"When true, offscreen child views (whose overflow value is hidden)\nare removed from their native backing superview when offscreen.  This\ncan improve scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is\ntrue.\"(The default value is false before version 0.14-rc).This is an extremely important optimization to apply on large ListViews.\nOn Android the overflow value is always hidden so you don't need to\nworry about setting it, but on iOS you need to be sure to set overflow:\nhidden on row containers.My component renders too slowly and I don't need it all immediately #It's common at first to overlook ListView, but using it properly is\noften key to achieving solid performance. As discussed above, it\nprovides you with a set of tools that lets you split rendering of your\nview across various frames and tweak that behavior to fit your specific\nneeds. Remember that ListView can be horizontal too.JS FPS plunges when re-rendering a view that hardly changes #If you are using a ListView, you must provide a rowHasChanged function\nthat can reduce a lot of work by quickly determining whether or not a\nrow needs to be re-rendered. If you are using immutable data structures,\nthis would be as simple as a reference equality check.Similarly, you can implement shouldComponentUpdate and indicate the\nexact conditions under which you would like the component to re-render.\nIf you write pure components (where the return value of the render\nfunction is entirely dependent on props and state), you can leverage\nPureRenderMixin to do this for you. Once again, immutable data\nstructures are useful to keep this fast -- if you have to do a deep\ncomparison of a large list of objects, it may be that re-rendering your\nentire component would be quicker, and it would certainly require less\ncode.Dropping JS thread FPS because of doing a lot of work on the JavaScript thread at the same time #\"Slow Navigator transitions\" is the most common manifestation of this,\nbut there are other times this can happen. Using InteractionManager can\nbe a good approach, but if the user experience cost is too high to delay\nwork during an animation, then you might want to consider\nLayoutAnimation.The Animated api currently calculates each keyframe on-demand on the\nJavaScript thread, while LayoutAnimation leverages Core Animation and is\nunaffected by JS thread and main thread frame drops.One case where I have used this is for animating in a modal (sliding\ndown from top and fading in a translucent overlay) while\ninitializing and perhaps receiving responses for several network\nrequests, rendering the contents of the modal, and updating the view\nwhere the modal was opened from. See the Animations guide for more\ninformation about how to use LayoutAnimation.Caveats:\n- LayoutAnimation only works for fire-and-forget animations (\"static\"\n  animations) -- if it must be be interruptible, you will need to use\nAnimated.Moving a view on the screen (scrolling, translating, rotating) drops UI thread FPS #This is especially true when you have text with a transparent background\npositioned on top of an image, or any other situation where alpha\ncompositing would be required to re-draw the view on each frame. You\nwill find that enabling shouldRasterizeIOS or renderToHardwareTextureAndroid\ncan help with this significantly.Be careful not to overuse this or your memory usage could go through the\nroof. Profile your performance and memory usage when using these props. If you don't plan to move a view anymore, turn this property off.Animating the size of an image drops UI thread FPS #On iOS, each time you adjust the width or height of an Image component\nit is re-cropped and scaled from the original image. This can be very expensive,\nespecially for large images. Instead, use the transform: [{scale}]\nstyle property to animate the size. An example of when you might do this is\nwhen you tap an image and zoom it in to full screen.My TouchableX view isn't very responsive #Sometimes, if we do an action in the same frame that we are adjusting\nthe opacity or highlight of a component that is responding to a touch,\nwe won't see that effect until after the onPress function has returned.\nIf onPress does a setState that results in a lot of work and a few\nframes dropped, this may occur. A solution to this is to wrap any action\ninside of your onPress handler in requestAnimationFrame:handleOnPress() {\n  // Always use TimerMixin with requestAnimationFrame, setTimeout and\n  // setInterval\n  this.requestAnimationFrame(() => {\n    this.doExpensiveAction();\n  });\n}Profiling #Use the built-in Profiler to get detailed information about work done in\nthe JavaScript thread and main thread side-by-side.For iOS, Instruments are an invaluable tool, and on Android you should\nlearn to use systrace.You can also use react-addons-perf to get insights into where React is spending time when rendering your components.Another way to profile JavaScript is to use the Chrome profiler while debugging. This won't give you accurate results as the code is running in Chrome but will give you a general idea of where bottlenecks might be.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Understanding the CLI","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/understanding-cli.html","content":"Understanding the CLI #Though you may have installed the react-native-cli via npm as a separate module, it is a shell for accessing the CLI embedded\nin the React Native of each project.

There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:View.props.onStartShouldSetResponder: (evt) => true, - Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?View.props.onMoveShouldSetResponder: (evt) => true, - Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:View.props.onResponderGrant: (evt) => {} - The View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happeningView.props.onResponderReject: (evt) => {} - Something else is the responder right now and will not release itIf the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:View.props.onResponderMove: (evt) => {} - The user is moving their fingerView.props.onResponderRelease: (evt) => {} - Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"View.props.onResponderTerminationRequest: (evt) => true - Something else wants to become responder. Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows releaseView.props.onResponderTerminate: (evt) => {} - The responder has been taken from the View. Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest, or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)evt is a synthetic touch event with the following form:nativeEventchangedTouches - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last eventidentifier - The ID of the touchlocationX - The X position of the touch, relative to the elementlocationY - The Y position of the touch, relative to the elementpageX - The X position of the touch, relative to the root elementpageY - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root elementtarget - The node id of the element receiving the touch eventtimestamp - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculationtouches - Array of all current touches on the screenCapture ShouldSet Handlers #onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture. So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.View.props.onStartShouldSetResponderCapture: (evt) => true,View.props.onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture: (evt) => true,PanResponder #For higher-level gesture interpretation, check out PanResponder.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Native Modules","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html","content":"Native Modules #Sometimes an app needs access to platform API, and React Native doesn't have a corresponding module yet. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions.We designed React Native such that it is possible for you to write real native code and have access to the full power of the platform. This is a more advanced feature and we don't expect it to be part of the usual development process, however it is essential that it exists. If React Native doesn't support a native feature that you need, you should be able to build it yourself.This is a more advanced guide that shows how to build a native module. It assumes the reader knows Objective-C or Swift and core libraries (Foundation, UIKit).iOS Calendar Module Example #This guide will use the iOS Calendar API example. Let's say we would like to be able to access the iOS calendar from JavaScript.A native module is just an Objective-C class that implements the RCTBridgeModule protocol. If you are wondering, RCT is an abbreviation of ReaCT.// CalendarManager.h\n#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>\n\n@interface CalendarManager : NSObject <RCTBridgeModule>\n@endIn addition to implementing the RCTBridgeModule protocol, your class must also include the RCT_EXPORT_MODULE() macro. This takes an optional argument that specifies the name that the module will be accessible as in your JavaScript code (more on this later). If you do not specify a name, the JavaScript module name will match the Objective-C class name.// CalendarManager.m\n@implementation CalendarManager\n\n// To export a module named CalendarManager\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE();\n\n// This would name the module AwesomeCalendarManager instead\n// RCT_EXPORT_MODULE(AwesomeCalendarManager);\n\n@endReact Native will not expose any methods of CalendarManager to JavaScript unless explicitly told to. This is done using the RCT_EXPORT_METHOD() macro:#import \"CalendarManager.h\"\n#import <React/RCTLog.h>\n\n@implementation CalendarManager\n\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE();\n\nRCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location)\n{\n  RCTLogInfo(@\"Pretending to create an event %@ at %@\", name, location);\n}Now, from your JavaScript file you can call the method like this:import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';\nvar CalendarManager = NativeModules.CalendarManager;\nCalendarManager.addEvent('Birthday Party', '4 Privet Drive, Surrey');NOTE: JavaScript method namesThe name of the method exported to JavaScript is the native method's name up to the first colon. React Native also defines a macro called RCT_REMAP_METHOD() to specify the JavaScript method's name. This is useful when multiple native methods are the same up to the first colon and would have conflicting JavaScript names.The CalendarManager module is instantiated on the Objective-C side using a [CalendarManager new] call. The return type of bridge methods is always void. React Native bridge is asynchronous, so the only way to pass a result to JavaScript is by using callbacks or emitting events (see below).Argument Types #RCT_EXPORT_METHOD supports all standard JSON object types, such as:string (NSString)number (NSInteger, float, double, CGFloat, NSNumber)boolean (BOOL, NSNumber)array (NSArray) of any types from this listobject (NSDictionary) with string keys and values of any type from this listfunction (RCTResponseSenderBlock)But it also works with any type that is supported by the RCTConvert class (see RCTConvert for details). The RCTConvert helper functions all accept a JSON value as input and map it to a native Objective-C type or class.In our CalendarManager example, we need to pass the event date to the native method. We can't send JavaScript Date objects over the bridge, so we need to convert the date to a string or number. We could write our native function like this:RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(nonnull NSNumber *)secondsSinceUnixEpoch)\n{\n  NSDate *date = [RCTConvert NSDate:secondsSinceUnixEpoch];\n}or like this:RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(NSString *)ISO8601DateString)\n{\n  NSDate *date = [RCTConvert NSDate:ISO8601DateString];\n}But by using the automatic type conversion feature, we can skip the manual conversion step completely, and just write:RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(NSDate *)date)\n{\n  // Date is ready to use!\n}You would then call this from JavaScript by using either:CalendarManager.addEvent('Birthday Party', '4 Privet Drive, Surrey', date.getTime()); // passing date as number of seconds since Unix epochorCalendarManager.addEvent('Birthday Party', '4 Privet Drive, Surrey', date.toISOString()); // passing date as ISO-8601 stringAnd both values would get converted correctly to the native NSDate.  A bad value, like an Array, would generate a helpful \"RedBox\" error message.As CalendarManager.addEvent method gets more and more complex, the number of arguments will grow. Some of them might be optional. In this case it's worth considering changing the API a little bit to accept a dictionary of event attributes, like this:#import <React/RCTConvert.h>\n\nRCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name details:(NSDictionary *)details)\n{\n  NSString *location = [RCTConvert NSString:details[@\"location\"]];\n  NSDate *time = [RCTConvert NSDate:details[@\"time\"]];\n  ...\n}and call it from JavaScript:CalendarManager.addEvent('Birthday Party', {\n  location: '4 Privet Drive, Surrey',\n  time: date.getTime(),\n  description: '...'\n})NOTE: About array and mapObjective-C doesn't provide any guarantees about the types of values in these structures. Your native module might expect an array of strings, but if JavaScript calls your method with an array containing numbers and strings, you'll get an NSArray containing a mix of NSNumber and NSString. For arrays, RCTConvert provides some typed collections you can use in your method declaration, such as NSStringArray, or UIColorArray. For maps, it is the developer's responsibility to check the value types individually by manually calling RCTConvert helper methods.Callbacks #WARNINGThis section is more experimental than others because we don't have a solid set of best practices around callbacks yet.Native modules also supports a special kind of argument- a callback. In most cases it is used to provide the function call result to JavaScript.RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(findEvents:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)\n{\n  NSArray *events = ...\n  callback(@[[NSNull null], events]);\n}RCTResponseSenderBlock accepts only one argument - an array of parameters to pass to the JavaScript callback. In this case we use Node's convention to make the first parameter an error object (usually null when there is no error) and the rest are the results of the function.CalendarManager.findEvents((error, events) => {\n  if (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  } else {\n    this.setState({events: events});\n  }\n})A native module should invoke its callback exactly once. It's okay to store the callback and invoke it later. This pattern is often used to wrap iOS APIs that require delegates - see RCTAlertManager for an example. If the callback is never invoked, some memory is leaked. If both onSuccess and onFail callbacks are passed, you should only invoke one of them.If you want to pass error-like objects to JavaScript, use RCTMakeError from RCTUtils.h.  Right now this just passes an Error-shaped dictionary to JavaScript, but we would like to automatically generate real JavaScript Error objects in the future.Promises #Native modules can also fulfill a promise, which can simplify your code, especially when using ES2016's async/await syntax. When the last parameters of a bridged native method are an RCTPromiseResolveBlock and RCTPromiseRejectBlock, its corresponding JS method will return a JS Promise object.Refactoring the above code to use a promise instead of callbacks looks like this:RCT_REMAP_METHOD(findEvents,\n                 resolver:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve\n                 rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)\n{\n  NSArray *events = ...\n  if (events) {\n    resolve(events);\n  } else {\n    NSError *error = ...\n    reject(@\"no_events\", @\"There were no events\", error);\n  }\n}The JavaScript counterpart of this method returns a Promise. This means you can use the await keyword within an async function to call it and wait for its result:async function updateEvents() {\n  try {\n    var events = await CalendarManager.findEvents();\n\n    this.setState({ events });\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error(e);\n  }\n}\n\nupdateEvents();Threading #The native module should not have any assumptions about what thread it is being called on. React Native invokes native modules methods on a separate serial GCD queue, but this is an implementation detail and might change.  The - (dispatch_queue_t)methodQueue method allows the native module to specify which queue its methods should be run on.  For example, if it needs to use a main-thread-only iOS API, it should specify this via:- (dispatch_queue_t)methodQueue\n{\n  return dispatch_get_main_queue();\n}Similarly, if an operation may take a long time to complete, the native module should not block and can specify it's own queue to run operations on. For example, the RCTAsyncLocalStorage module creates it's own queue so the React queue isn't blocked waiting on potentially slow disk access:- (dispatch_queue_t)methodQueue\n{\n  return dispatch_queue_create(\"com.facebook.React.AsyncLocalStorageQueue\", DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL);\n}The specified methodQueue will be shared by all of the methods in your module. If just one of your methods is long-running (or needs to be run on a different queue than the others for some reason), you can use dispatch_async inside the method to perform that particular method's code on another queue, without affecting the others:RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(doSomethingExpensive:(NSString *)param callback:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)\n{\n  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{\n    // Call long-running code on background thread\n    ...\n    // You can invoke callback from any thread/queue\n    callback(@[...]);\n  });\n}NOTE: Sharing dispatch queues between modulesThe methodQueue method will be called once when the module is initialized, and then retained by the bridge, so there is no need to retain the queue yourself, unless you wish to make use of it within your module. However, if you wish to share the same queue between multiple modules then you will need to ensure that you retain and return the same queue instance for each of them; merely returning a queue of the same name for each won't work.Dependency Injection #The bridge initializes any registered RCTBridgeModules automatically, however you may wish to instantiate your own module instances (so you may inject dependencies, for example).You can do this by creating a class that implements the RCTBridgeDelegate Protocol, initializing an RCTBridge with the delegate as an argument and initialising a RCTRootView with the initialized bridge.id<RCTBridgeDelegate> moduleInitialiser = [[classThatImplementsRCTBridgeDelegate alloc] init];\n\nRCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:moduleInitialiser launchOptions:nil];\n\nRCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc]\n                        initWithBridge:bridge\n                            moduleName:kModuleName\n                     initialProperties:nil];Exporting Constants #A native module can export constants that are immediately available to JavaScript at runtime. This is useful for communicating static data that would otherwise require a round-trip through the bridge.- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport\n{\n  return @{ @\"firstDayOfTheWeek\": @\"Monday\" };\n}JavaScript can use this value right away, synchronously:console.log(CalendarManager.firstDayOfTheWeek);Note that the constants are exported only at initialization time, so if you change constantsToExport values at runtime it won't affect the JavaScript environment.Enum Constants #Enums that are defined via NS_ENUM cannot be used as method arguments without first extending RCTConvert.In order to export the following NS_ENUM definition:typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, UIStatusBarAnimation) {\n    UIStatusBarAnimationNone,\n    UIStatusBarAnimationFade,\n    UIStatusBarAnimationSlide,\n};You must create a class extension of RCTConvert like so:@implementation RCTConvert (StatusBarAnimation)\n  RCT_ENUM_CONVERTER(UIStatusBarAnimation, (@{ @\"statusBarAnimationNone\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationNone),\n                                               @\"statusBarAnimationFade\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationFade),\n                                               @\"statusBarAnimationSlide\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationSlide)}),\n                      UIStatusBarAnimationNone, integerValue)\n@endYou can then define methods and export your enum constants like this:- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport\n{\n  return @{ @\"statusBarAnimationNone\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationNone),\n            @\"statusBarAnimationFade\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationFade),\n            @\"statusBarAnimationSlide\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationSlide) }\n};\n\nRCT_EXPORT_METHOD(updateStatusBarAnimation:(UIStatusBarAnimation)animation\n                                completion:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)Your enum will then be automatically unwrapped using the selector provided (integerValue in the above example) before being passed to your exported method.Sending Events to JavaScript #The native module can signal events to JavaScript without being invoked directly. The preferred way to do this is to subclass RCTEventEmitter, implement suppportEvents and call self sendEventWithName:// CalendarManager.h\n#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>\n#import <React/RCTEventEmitter.h>\n\n@interface CalendarManager : RCTEventEmitter <RCTBridgeModule>\n\n@end// CalendarManager.m\n#import \"CalendarManager.h\"\n\n@implementation CalendarManager\n\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE();\n\n- (NSArray<NSString *> *)supportedEvents\n{\n  return @[@\"EventReminder\"];\n}\n\n- (void)calendarEventReminderReceived:(NSNotification *)notification\n{\n  NSString *eventName = notification.userInfo[@\"name\"];\n  [self sendEventWithName:@\"EventReminder\" body:@{@\"name\": eventName}];\n}\n\n@endJavaScript code can subscribe to these events by creating a new NativeEventEmitter instance around your module.import { NativeEventEmitter, NativeModules } from 'react-native';\nconst { CalendarManager } = NativeModules;\n\nconst calendarManagerEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(CalendarManager);\n\nconst subscription = calendarManagerEmitter.addListener(\n  'EventReminder',\n  (reminder) => console.log(reminder.name)\n);\n...\n// Don't forget to unsubscribe, typically in componentWillUnmount\nsubscription.remove();For more examples of sending events to JavaScript, see RCTLocationObserver.Optimizing for zero listeners #You will receive a warning if you expend resources unnecessarily by emitting an event while there are no listeners. To avoid this, and to optimize your module's workload (e.g. by unsubscribing from upstream notifications or pausing background tasks), you can override startObserving and stopObserving in your RCTEventEmitter subclass.@implementation CalendarManager\n{\n  bool hasListeners;\n}\n\n// Will be called when this module's first listener is added.\n-(void)startObserving { \n    hasListeners = YES;\n    // Set up any upstream listeners or background tasks as necessary\n}\n\n// Will be called when this module's last listener is removed, or on dealloc.\n-(void)stopObserving { \n    hasListeners = NO;\n    // Remove upstream listeners, stop unnecessary background tasks\n}\n\n- (void)calendarEventReminderReceived:(NSNotification *)notification\n{\n  NSString *eventName = notification.userInfo[@\"name\"];\n  if (hasListeners) { // Only send events if anyone is listening\n    [self sendEventWithName:@\"EventReminder\" body:@{@\"name\": eventName}];\n  }\n}Exporting Swift #Swift doesn't have support for macros so exposing it to React Native requires a bit more setup but works relatively the same.Let's say we have the same CalendarManager but as a Swift class:// CalendarManager.swift\n\n@objc(CalendarManager)\nclass CalendarManager: NSObject {\n\n  @objc(addEvent:location:date:)\n  func addEvent(name: String, location: String, date: NSNumber) -> Void {\n    // Date is ready to use!\n  }\n\n}NOTE: It is important to use the @objc modifiers to ensure the class and functions are exported properly to the Objective-C runtime.Then create a private implementation file that will register the required information with the React Native bridge:// CalendarManagerBridge.m\n#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>\n\n@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(CalendarManager, NSObject)\n\nRCT_EXTERN_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(nonnull NSNumber *)date)\n\n@endFor those of you new to Swift and Objective-C, whenever you mix the two languages in an iOS project, you will also need an additional bridging file, known as a bridging header, to expose the Objective-C files to Swift. Xcode will offer to create this header file for you if you add your Swift file to your app through the Xcode File>New File menu option. You will need to import RCTBridgeModule.h in this header file.// CalendarManager-Bridging-Header.h\n#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>You can also use RCT_EXTERN_REMAP_MODULE and RCT_EXTERN_REMAP_METHOD to alter the JavaScript name of the module or methods you are exporting.

React Native has several of the most critical platform components already wrapped, like ScrollView and TextInput, but not all of them, and certainly not ones you might have written yourself for a previous app.  Fortunately, it's quite easy to wrap up these existing components for seamless integration with your React Native application.Like the native module guide, this too is a more advanced guide that assumes you are somewhat familiar with iOS programming.  This guide will show you how to build a native UI component, walking you through the implementation of a subset of the existing MapView component available in the core React Native library.iOS MapView example #Let's say we want to add an interactive Map to our app - might as well use MKMapView, we just need to make it usable from JavaScript.Native views are created and manipulated by subclasses of RCTViewManager.  These subclasses are similar in function to view controllers, but are essentially singletons - only one instance of each is created by the bridge.  They vend native views to the RCTUIManager, which delegates back to them to set and update the properties of the views as necessary.  The RCTViewManagers are also typically the delegates for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge.Vending a view is simple:Create the basic subclass.Add the RCT_EXPORT_MODULE() marker macro.Implement the -(UIView *)view method.// RNTMapManager.m\n#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>\n\n#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>\n\n@interface RNTMapManager : RCTViewManager\n@end\n\n@implementation RNTMapManager\n\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE()\n\n- (UIView *)view\n{\n  return [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n}\n\n@endNote: Do not attempt to set the frame or backgroundColor properties on the UIView instance that you vend through the -view method. React Native will overwrite the values set by your custom class in order to match your JavaScript component's layout props. If you need this granularity of control it might be better to wrap the UIView instance you want to style in another UIView and return the wrapper UIView instead. See Issue 2948 for more context.In the example above, we prefixed our class name with RNT. Prefixes are used to avoid name collisions with other frameworks. Apple frameworks use two-letter prefixes, and React Native uses RCT as a prefix. In order to avoid name collisions, we recommend using a three-letter prefix other than RCT in your own classes.Then you just need a little bit of JavaScript to make this a usable React component:// MapView.js\n\nimport { requireNativeComponent } from 'react-native';\n\n// requireNativeComponent automatically resolves this to \"RNTMapManager\"\nmodule.exports = requireNativeComponent('RNTMap', null);This is now a fully-functioning native map view component in JavaScript, complete with pinch-zoom and other native gesture support.  We can't really control it from JavaScript yet, though :(Properties #The first thing we can do to make this component more usable is to bridge over some native properties. Let's say we want to be able to disable pitch control and specify the visible region.  Disabling pitch is a simple boolean, so we add this one line:// RNTMapManager.m\nRCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(pitchEnabled, BOOL)Note that we explicitly specify the type as BOOL - React Native uses RCTConvert under the hood to convert all sorts of different data types when talking over the bridge, and bad values will show convenient \"RedBox\" errors to let you know there is an issue ASAP.  When things are straightforward like this, the whole implementation is taken care of for you by this macro.Now to actually disable pitch, we set the property in JS:// MyApp.js\n<MapView pitchEnabled={false} />This isn't very well documented though - in order to know what properties are available and what values they accept, the client of your new component needs to dig through the Objective-C code.  To make this better, let's make a wrapper component and document the interface with React PropTypes:// MapView.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { requireNativeComponent } from 'react-native';\n\nclass MapView extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <RNTMap {...this.props} />;\n  }\n}\n\nMapView.propTypes = {\n  /**\n   * When this property is set to `true` and a valid camera is associated\n   * with the map, the camera’s pitch angle is used to tilt the plane\n   * of the map. When this property is set to `false`, the camera’s pitch\n   * angle is ignored and the map is always displayed as if the user\n   * is looking straight down onto it.\n   */\n  pitchEnabled: React.PropTypes.bool,\n};\n\nvar RNTMap = requireNativeComponent('RNTMap', MapView);\n\nmodule.exports = MapView;Now we have a nicely documented wrapper component that is easy to work with.  Note that we changed the second argument to requireNativeComponent from null to the new MapView wrapper component.  This allows the infrastructure to verify that the propTypes match the native props to reduce the chances of mismatches between the ObjC and JS code.Next, let's add the more complex region prop.  We start by adding the native code:// RNTMapManager.m\nRCT_CUSTOM_VIEW_PROPERTY(region, MKCoordinateRegion, RNTMap)\n{\n  [view setRegion:json ? [RCTConvert MKCoordinateRegion:json] : defaultView.region animated:YES];\n}Ok, this is more complicated than the simple BOOL case we had before.  Now we have a MKCoordinateRegion type that needs a conversion function, and we have custom code so that the view will animate when we set the region from JS.  Within the function body that we provide, json refers to the raw value that has been passed from JS.  There is also a view variable which gives us access to the manager's view instance, and a defaultView that we use to reset the property back to the default value if JS sends us a null sentinel.You could write any conversion function you want for your view - here is the implementation for MKCoordinateRegion via two categories on RCTConvert:@implementation RCTConvert(CoreLocation)\n\nRCT_CONVERTER(CLLocationDegrees, CLLocationDegrees, doubleValue);\nRCT_CONVERTER(CLLocationDistance, CLLocationDistance, doubleValue);\n\n+ (CLLocationCoordinate2D)CLLocationCoordinate2D:(id)json\n{\n  json = [self NSDictionary:json];\n  return (CLLocationCoordinate2D){\n    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@\"latitude\"]],\n    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@\"longitude\"]]\n  };\n}\n\n@end\n\n@implementation RCTConvert(MapKit)\n\n+ (MKCoordinateSpan)MKCoordinateSpan:(id)json\n{\n  json = [self NSDictionary:json];\n  return (MKCoordinateSpan){\n    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@\"latitudeDelta\"]],\n    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@\"longitudeDelta\"]]\n  };\n}\n\n+ (MKCoordinateRegion)MKCoordinateRegion:(id)json\n{\n  return (MKCoordinateRegion){\n    [self CLLocationCoordinate2D:json],\n    [self MKCoordinateSpan:json]\n  };\n}These conversion functions are designed to safely process any JSON that the JS might throw at them by displaying \"RedBox\" errors and returning standard initialization values when missing keys or other developer errors are encountered.To finish up support for the region prop, we need to document it in propTypes (or we'll get an error that the native prop is undocumented), then we can set it just like any other prop:// MapView.js\n\nMapView.propTypes = {\n  /**\n   * When this property is set to `true` and a valid camera is associated\n   * with the map, the camera’s pitch angle is used to tilt the plane\n   * of the map. When this property is set to `false`, the camera’s pitch\n   * angle is ignored and the map is always displayed as if the user\n   * is looking straight down onto it.\n   */\n  pitchEnabled: React.PropTypes.bool,\n\n  /**\n   * The region to be displayed by the map.\n   *\n   * The region is defined by the center coordinates and the span of\n   * coordinates to display.\n   */\n  region: React.PropTypes.shape({\n    /**\n     * Coordinates for the center of the map.\n     */\n    latitude: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n    longitude: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n\n    /**\n     * Distance between the minimum and the maximum latitude/longitude\n     * to be displayed.\n     */\n    latitudeDelta: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n    longitudeDelta: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n  }),\n};\n\n// MyApp.js\n\n  render() {\n    var region = {\n      latitude: 37.48,\n      longitude: -122.16,\n      latitudeDelta: 0.1,\n      longitudeDelta: 0.1,\n    };\n    return <MapView region={region} />;\n  }Here you can see that the shape of the region is explicit in the JS documentation - ideally we could codegen some of this stuff, but that's not happening yet.Sometimes you'll have some special properties that you need to expose for the native component, but don't actually want them as part of the API for the associated React component.  For example, Switch has a custom onChange handler for the raw native event, and exposes an onValueChange handler property that is invoked with just the boolean value rather than the raw event.  Since you don't want these native only properties to be part of the API, you don't want to put them in propTypes, but if you don't you'll get an error.  The solution is simply to call them out via the nativeOnly option, e.g.var RCTSwitch = requireNativeComponent('RCTSwitch', Switch, {\n  nativeOnly: { onChange: true }\n});Events #So now we have a native map component that we can control easily from JS, but how do we deal with events from the user, like pinch-zooms or panning to change the visible region?  The key is to declare an event handler property on RNTMapManager, make it a delegate for all the views it vends, and forward events to JS by calling the event handler block from the native view.  This looks like so (simplified from the full implementation):// RNTMap.h\n\n#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>\n\n#import <React/RCTComponent.h>\n\n@interface RNTMap: MKMapView\n\n@property (nonatomic, copy) RCTBubblingEventBlock onChange;\n\n@end// RNTMap.m\n\n#import \"RNTMap.h\"\n\n@implementation RNTMap\n\n@end// RNTMapManager.m\n\n#import \"RNTMapManager.h\"\n\n#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>\n\n#import \"RNTMap.h\"\n#import <React/UIView+React.h>\n\n@interface RNTMapManager() <MKMapViewDelegate>\n@end\n\n@implementation RNTMapManager\n\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE()\n\nRCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(onChange, RCTBubblingEventBlock)\n\n- (UIView *)view\n{\n  RNTMap *map = [RNTMap new];\n  map.delegate = self;\n  return map;\n}\n\n#pragma mark MKMapViewDelegate\n\n- (void)mapView:(RNTMap *)mapView regionDidChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated\n{\n  if (!mapView.onChange) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  MKCoordinateRegion region = mapView.region;\n  mapView.onChange(@{\n    @\"region\": @{\n      @\"latitude\": @(region.center.latitude),\n      @\"longitude\": @(region.center.longitude),\n      @\"latitudeDelta\": @(region.span.latitudeDelta),\n      @\"longitudeDelta\": @(region.span.longitudeDelta),\n    }\n  });\n}You can see we're adding an event handler property to the view by subclassing MKMapView.  Then we're exposing the onChange event handler property and setting the manager as the delegate for every view that it vends. Finally, in the delegate method -mapView:regionDidChangeAnimated: the event handler block is called on the corresponding view with the region data.  Calling the onChange event handler block results in calling the same callback prop in JavaScript.  This callback is invoked with the raw event, which we typically process in the wrapper component to make a simpler API:// MapView.js\n\nclass MapView extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    this._onChange = this._onChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  _onChange(event: Event) {\n    if (!this.props.onRegionChange) {\n      return;\n    }\n    this.props.onRegionChange(event.nativeEvent.region);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <RNTMap {...this.props} onChange={this._onChange} />;\n  }\n}\nMapView.propTypes = {\n  /**\n   * Callback that is called continuously when the user is dragging the map.\n   */\n  onRegionChange: React.PropTypes.func,\n  ...\n};Styles #Since all our native react views are subclasses of UIView, most style attributes will work like you would expect out of the box.  Some components will want a default style, however, for example UIDatePicker which is a fixed size.  This default style is important for the layout algorithm to work as expected, but we also want to be able to override the default style when using the component.  DatePickerIOS does this by wrapping the native component in an extra view, which has flexible styling, and using a fixed style (which is generated with constants passed in from native) on the inner native component:// DatePickerIOS.ios.js\n\nimport { UIManager } from 'react-native';\nvar RCTDatePickerIOSConsts = UIManager.RCTDatePicker.Constants;\n...\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <View style={this.props.style}>\n        <RCTDatePickerIOS\n          ref={DATEPICKER}\n          style={styles.rkDatePickerIOS}\n          ...\n        />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  rkDatePickerIOS: {\n    height: RCTDatePickerIOSConsts.ComponentHeight,\n    width: RCTDatePickerIOSConsts.ComponentWidth,\n  },\n});The RCTDatePickerIOSConsts constants are exported from native by grabbing the actual frame of the native component like so:// RCTDatePickerManager.m\n\n- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport\n{\n  UIDatePicker *dp = [[UIDatePicker alloc] init];\n  [dp layoutIfNeeded];\n\n  return @{\n    @\"ComponentHeight\": @(CGRectGetHeight(dp.frame)),\n    @\"ComponentWidth\": @(CGRectGetWidth(dp.frame)),\n    @\"DatePickerModes\": @{\n      @\"time\": @(UIDatePickerModeTime),\n      @\"date\": @(UIDatePickerModeDate),\n      @\"datetime\": @(UIDatePickerModeDateAndTime),\n    }\n  };\n}This guide covered many of the aspects of bridging over custom native components, but there is even more you might need to consider, such as custom hooks for inserting and laying out subviews.

When we mix native and React Native components, we'll eventually find a need to communicate between these two worlds. Some ways to achieve that have been already mentioned in other guides. This article summarizes available techniques.Introduction #React Native is inspired by React, so the basic idea of the information flow is similar. The flow in React is one-directional. We maintain a hierarchy of components, in which each component depends only on its parent and its own internal state. We do this with properties: data is passed from a parent to its children in a top-down manner. If an ancestor component relies on the state of its descendant, one should pass down a callback to be used by the descendant to update the ancestor.The same concept applies to React Native. As long as we are building our application purely within the framework, we can drive our app with properties and callbacks. But, when we mix React Native and native components, we need some special, cross-language mechanisms that would allow us to pass information between them.Properties #Properties are the simplest way of cross-component communication. So we need a way to pass properties both from native to React Native, and from React Native to native.Passing properties from native to React Native #In order to embed a React Native view in a native component, we use RCTRootView. RCTRootView is a UIView that holds a React Native app. It also provides an interface between native side and the hosted app.RCTRootView has an initializer that allows you to pass arbitrary properties down to the React Native app. The initialProperties parameter has to be an instance of NSDictionary. The dictionary is internally converted into a JSON object that the top-level JS component can reference.NSArray *imageList = @[@\"http://foo.com/bar1.png\",\n                       @\"http://foo.com/bar2.png\"];\n\nNSDictionary *props = @{@\"images\" : imageList};\n\nRCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge\n                                                 moduleName:@\"ImageBrowserApp\"\n                                          initialProperties:props];'use strict';\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {\n  AppRegistry,\n  View,\n  Image\n} from 'react-native';\n\nclass ImageBrowserApp extends React.Component {\n  renderImage(imgURI) {\n    return (\n      <Image source={{uri: imgURI}} />\n    );\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        {this.props.images.map(this.renderImage)}\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('ImageBrowserApp', () => ImageBrowserApp);RCTRootView also provides a read-write property appProperties. After appProperties is set, the React Native app is re-rendered with new properties. The update is only performed when the new updated properties differ from the previous ones.NSArray *imageList = @[@\"http://foo.com/bar3.png\",\n                       @\"http://foo.com/bar4.png\"];\n\nrootView.appProperties = @{@\"images\" : imageList};It is fine to update properties anytime. However, updates have to be performed on the main thread. You use the getter on any thread.There is no way to update only a few properties at a time. We suggest that you build it into your own wrapper instead.Note:\nCurrently, JS functions componentWillReceiveProps and componentWillUpdateProps of the top level RN component will not be called after a prop update. However, you can access the new props in componentWillMount function.Passing properties from React Native to native #The problem exposing properties of native components is covered in detail in this article. In short, export properties with RCT_CUSTOM_VIEW_PROPERTY macro in your custom native component, then just use them in React Native as if the component was an ordinary React Native component.Limits of properties #The main drawback of cross-language properties is that they do not support callbacks, which would allow us to handle bottom-up data bindings. Imagine you have a small RN view that you want to be removed from the native parent view as a result of a JS action. There is no way to do that with props, as the information would need to go bottom-up.Although we have a flavor of cross-language callbacks (described here), these callbacks are not always the thing we need. The main problem is that they are not intended to be passed as properties. Rather, this mechanism allows us to trigger a native action from JS, and handle the result of that action in JS.Other ways of cross-language interaction (events and native modules) #As stated in the previous chapter, using properties comes with some limitations. Sometimes properties are not enough to drive the logic of our app and we need a solution that gives more flexibility. This chapter covers other communication techniques available in React Native. They can be used for internal communication (between JS and native layers in RN) as well as for external communication (between RN and the 'pure native' part of your app).React Native enables you to perform cross-language function calls. You can execute custom native code from JS and vice versa. Unfortunately, depending on the side we are working on, we achieve the same goal in different ways. For native - we use events mechanism to schedule an execution of a handler function in JS, while for React Native we directly call methods exported by native modules.Calling React Native functions from native (events) #Events are described in detail in this article. Note that using events gives us no guarantees about execution time, as the event is handled on a separate thread.Events are powerful, because they allow us to change React Native components without needing a reference to them. However, there are some pitfalls that you can fall into while using them:As events can be sent from anywhere, they can introduce spaghetti-style dependencies into your project.Events share namespace, which means that you may encounter some name collisions. Collisions will not be detected statically, which makes them hard to debug.If you use several instances of the same React Native component and you want to distinguish them from the perspective of your event, you'll likely need to introduce identifiers and pass them along with events (you can use the native view's reactTag as an identifier).The common pattern we use when embedding native in React Native is to make the native component's RCTViewManager a delegate for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge. This keeps related event calls in one place.Calling native functions from React Native (native modules) #Native modules are Objective-C classes that are available in JS. Typically one instance of each module is created per JS bridge. They can export arbitrary functions and constants to React Native. They have been covered in detail in this article.The fact that native modules are singletons limits the mechanism in the context of embedding. Let's say we have a React Native component embedded in a native view and we want to update the native, parent view. Using the native module mechanism, we would export a function that not only takes expected arguments, but also an identifier of the parent native view. The identifier would be used to retrieve a reference to the parent view to update. That said, we would need to keep a mapping from identifiers to native views in the module.Although this solution is complex, it is used in RCTUIManager, which is an internal React Native class that manages all React Native views.Native modules can also be used to expose existing native libraries to JS. The Geolocation library is a living example of the idea.Warning:\nAll native modules share the same namespace. Watch out for name collisions when creating new ones.Layout computation flow #When integrating native and React Native, we also need a way to consolidate two different layout systems. This section covers common layout problems and provides a brief description of mechanisms to address them.Layout of a native component embedded in React Native #This case is covered in this article. Basically, as all our native react views are subclasses of UIView, most style and size attributes will work like you would expect out of the box.Layout of a React Native component embedded in native #React Native content with fixed size #The simplest scenario is when we have a React Native app with a fixed size, which is known to the native side. In particular, a full-screen React Native view falls into this case. If we want a smaller root view, we can explicitly set RCTRootView's frame.For instance, to make an RN app 200 (logical) pixels high, and the hosting view's width wide, we could do:// SomeViewController.m\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n  [...]\n  RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge\n                                                   moduleName:appName\n                                            initialProperties:props];\n  rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.width, 200);\n  [self.view addSubview:rootView];\n}When we have a fixed size root view, we need to respect its bounds on the JS side. In other words, we need to ensure that the React Native content can be contained within the fixed-size root view. The easiest way to ensure this is to use flexbox layout. If you use absolute positioning, and React components are visible outside the root view's bounds, you'll get overlap with native views, causing some features to behave unexpectedly. For instance, 'TouchableHighlight' will not highlight your touches outside the root view's bounds.It's totally fine to update root view's size dynamically by re-setting its frame property. React Native will take care of the content's layout.React Native content with flexible size #In some cases we'd like to render content of initially unknown size. Let's say the size will be defined dynamically in JS. We have two solutions to this problem.You can wrap your React Native view in a ScrollView component. This guarantees that your content will always be available and it won't overlap with native views.React Native allows you to determine, in JS, the size of the RN app and provide it to the owner of the hosting RCTRootView. The owner is then responsible for re-laying out the subviews and keeping the UI consistent. We achieve this with RCTRootView's flexibility modes.RCTRootView supports 4 different size flexibility modes:// RCTRootView.h\n\ntypedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, RCTRootViewSizeFlexibility) {\n  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityNone = 0,\n  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidth,\n  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight,\n  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidthAndHeight,\n};RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityNone is the default value, which makes a root view's size fixed (but it still can be updated with setFrame:). The other three modes allow us to track React Native content's size updates. For instance, setting mode to RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight will cause React Native to measure the content's height and pass that information back to RCTRootView's delegate. An arbitrary action can be performed within the delegate, including setting the root view's frame, so the content fits. The delegate is called only when the size of the content has changed.Warning:\nMaking a dimension flexible in both JS and native leads to undefined behavior. For example - don't make a top-level React component's width flexible (with flexbox) while you're using RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidth on the hosting RCTRootView.Let's look at an example.// FlexibleSizeExampleView.m\n\n- (instancetype)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame\n{\n  [...]\n\n  _rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge\n  moduleName:@\"FlexibilityExampleApp\"\n  initialProperties:@{}];\n\n  _rootView.delegate = self;\n  _rootView.sizeFlexibility = RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight;\n  _rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, 0);\n}\n\n#pragma mark - RCTRootViewDelegate\n- (void)rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize:(RCTRootView *)rootView\n{\n  CGRect newFrame = rootView.frame;\n  newFrame.size = rootView.intrinsicContentSize;\n\n  rootView.frame = newFrame;\n}In the example we have a FlexibleSizeExampleView view that holds a root view. We create the root view, initialize it and set the delegate. The delegate will handle size updates. Then, we set the root view's size flexibility to RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight, which means that rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize: method will be called every time the React Native content changes its height. Finally, we set the root view's width and position. Note that we set there height as well, but it has no effect as we made the height RN-dependent.You can checkout full source code of the example here.It's fine to change root view's size flexibility mode dynamically. Changing flexibility mode of a root view will schedule a layout recalculation and the delegate rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize: method will be called once the content size is known.Note: React Native layout calculation is performed on a special thread, while native UI view updates are done on the main thread. This may cause temporary UI inconsistencies between native and React Native. This is a known problem and our team is working on synchronizing UI updates coming from different sources.Note: React Native does not perform any layout calculations until the root view becomes a subview of some other views. If you want to hide React Native view until its dimensions are known, add the root view as a subview and make it initially hidden (use UIView's hidden property). Then change its visibility in the delegate method.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Native Modules","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android.html","content":"Native Modules #Sometimes an app needs access to a platform API that React Native doesn't have a corresponding module for yet. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Java code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions.We designed React Native such that it is possible for you to write real native code and have access to the full power of the platform. This is a more advanced feature and we don't expect it to be part of the usual development process, however it is essential that it exists. If React Native doesn't support a native feature that you need, you should be able to build it yourself.Enable Gradle #If you plan to make changes in Java code, we recommend enabling Gradle Daemon to speed up builds.The Toast Module #This guide will use the Toast example. Let's say we would like to be able to create a toast message from JavaScript.We start by creating a native module. A native module is a Java class that usually extends the ReactContextBaseJavaModule class and implements the functionality required by the JavaScript. Our goal here is to be able to write ToastAndroid.show('Awesome', ToastAndroid.SHORT); from JavaScript to display a short toast on the screen.package com.facebook.react.modules.toast;\n\nimport android.widget.Toast;\n\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule;\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContext;\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContextBaseJavaModule;\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactMethod;\n\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class ToastModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\n\n  private static final String DURATION_SHORT_KEY = \"SHORT\";\n  private static final String DURATION_LONG_KEY = \"LONG\";\n\n  public ToastModule(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\n    super(reactContext);\n  }\n}ReactContextBaseJavaModule requires that a method called getName is implemented. The purpose of this method is to return the string name of the NativeModule which represents this class in JavaScript. So here we will call this ToastAndroid so that we can access it through React.NativeModules.ToastAndroid in JavaScript.  @Override\n  public String getName() {\n    return \"ToastAndroid\";\n  }An optional method called getConstants returns the constant values exposed to JavaScript. Its implementation is not required but is very useful to key pre-defined values that need to be communicated from JavaScript to Java in sync.  @Override\n  public Map<String, Object> getConstants() {\n    final Map<String, Object> constants = new HashMap<>();\n    constants.put(DURATION_SHORT_KEY, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);\n    constants.put(DURATION_LONG_KEY, Toast.LENGTH_LONG);\n    return constants;\n  }To expose a method to JavaScript a Java method must be annotated using @ReactMethod. The return type of bridge methods is always void. React Native bridge is asynchronous, so the only way to pass a result to JavaScript is by using callbacks or emitting events (see below).  @ReactMethod\n  public void show(String message, int duration) {\n    Toast.makeText(getReactApplicationContext(), message, duration).show();\n  }Argument Types #The following argument types are supported for methods annotated with @ReactMethod and they directly map to their JavaScript equivalentsBoolean -> Bool\nInteger -> Number\nDouble -> Number\nFloat -> Number\nString -> String\nCallback -> function\nReadableMap -> Object\nReadableArray -> ArrayRead more about ReadableMap and ReadableArrayRegister the Module #The last step within Java is to register the Module; this happens in the createNativeModules of your apps package.

This is not necessary but saves the consumers of your library the need to pull it off of NativeModules each time. This JavaScript file also becomes a good location for you to add any JavaScript side functionality.'use strict';\n/**\n * This exposes the native ToastAndroid module as a JS module.

In most cases it is used to provide the function call result to JavaScript.public class UIManagerModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\n\n...\n\n  @ReactMethod\n  public void measureLayout(\n      int tag,\n      int ancestorTag,\n      Callback errorCallback,\n      Callback successCallback) {\n    try {\n      measureLayout(tag, ancestorTag, mMeasureBuffer);\n      float relativeX = PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[0]);\n      float relativeY = PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[1]);\n      float width = PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[2]);\n      float height = PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[3]);\n      successCallback.invoke(relativeX, relativeY, width, height);\n    } catch (IllegalViewOperationException e) {\n      errorCallback.invoke(e.getMessage());\n    }\n  }\n\n...This method would be accessed in JavaScript using:UIManager.measureLayout(\n  100,\n  100,\n  (msg) => {\n    console.log(msg);\n  },\n  (x, y, width, height) => {\n    console.log(x + ':' + y + ':' + width + ':' + height);\n  }\n);A native module is supposed to invoke its callback only once. It can, however, store the callback and invoke it later.It is very important to highlight that the callback is not invoked immediately after the native function completes - remember that bridge communication is asynchronous, and this too is tied to the run loop.Promises #Native modules can also fulfill a promise, which can simplify your code, especially when using ES2016's async/await syntax. When the last parameter of a bridged native method is a Promise, its corresponding JS method will return a JS Promise object.Refactoring the above code to use a promise instead of callbacks looks like this:import com.facebook.react.bridge.Promise;\n\npublic class UIManagerModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\n\n...\n  private static final String E_LAYOUT_ERROR = \"E_LAYOUT_ERROR\";\n  @ReactMethod\n  public void measureLayout(\n      int tag,\n      int ancestorTag,\n      Promise promise) {\n    try {\n      measureLayout(tag, ancestorTag, mMeasureBuffer);\n\n      WritableMap map = Arguments.createMap();\n\n      map.putDouble(\"relativeX\", PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[0]));\n      map.putDouble(\"relativeY\", PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[1]));\n      map.putDouble(\"width\", PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[2]));\n      map.putDouble(\"height\", PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[3]));\n\n      promise.resolve(map);\n    } catch (IllegalViewOperationException e) {\n      promise.reject(E_LAYOUT_ERROR, e);\n    }\n  }\n\n...The JavaScript counterpart of this method returns a Promise. This means you can use the await keyword within an async function to call it and wait for its result:async function measureLayout() {\n  try {\n    var {\n      relativeX,\n      relativeY,\n      width,\n      height,\n    } = await UIManager.measureLayout(100, 100);\n\n    console.log(relativeX + ':' + relativeY + ':' + width + ':' + height);\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error(e);\n  }\n}\n\nmeasureLayout();Threading #Native modules should not have any assumptions about what thread they are being called on, as the current assignment is subject to change in the future. If a blocking call is required, the heavy work should be dispatched to an internally managed worker thread, and any callbacks distributed from there.Sending Events to JavaScript #Native modules can signal events to JavaScript without being invoked directly. The easiest way to do this is to use the RCTDeviceEventEmitter which can be obtained from the ReactContext as in the code snippet below....\nprivate void sendEvent(ReactContext reactContext,\n                       String eventName,\n                       @Nullable WritableMap params) {\n  reactContext\n      .getJSModule(DeviceEventManagerModule.RCTDeviceEventEmitter.class)\n      .emit(eventName, params);\n}\n...\nWritableMap params = Arguments.createMap();\n...\nsendEvent(reactContext, \"keyboardWillShow\", params);JavaScript modules can then register to receive events by addListenerOn using the Subscribable mixinimport { DeviceEventEmitter } from 'react-native';\n...\n\nvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n\n\n  componentWillMount: function() {\n    ...\n    this.addListenerOn(DeviceEventEmitter,\n                       'keyboardWillShow',\n                       this.scrollResponderKeyboardWillShow);\n    ...\n  },\n  scrollResponderKeyboardWillShow:function(e: Event) {\n    this.keyboardWillOpenTo = e;\n    this.props.onKeyboardWillShow && this.props.onKeyboardWillShow(e);\n  },You can also directly use the DeviceEventEmitter module to listen for events....\ncomponentWillMount: function() {\n  DeviceEventEmitter.addListener('keyboardWillShow', function(e: Event) {\n    // handle event.\n  });\n}\n...Getting activity result from startActivityForResult #You'll need to listen to onActivityResult if you want to get results from an activity you started with startActivityForResult. To do this, you must extend BaseActivityEventListener or implement ActivityEventListener. The former is preferred as it is more resilient to API changes. Then, you need to register the listener in the module's constructor,reactContext.addActivityEventListener(mActivityResultListener);Now you can listen to onActivityResult by implementing the following method:@Override\npublic void onActivityResult(\n  final Activity activity,\n  final int requestCode,\n  final int resultCode,\n  final Intent intent) {\n  // Your logic here\n}We will implement a simple image picker to demonstrate this. The image picker will expose the method pickImage to JavaScript, which will return the path of the image when called.public class ImagePickerModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\n\n  private static final int IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST = 467081;\n  private static final String E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST = \"E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST\";\n  private static final String E_PICKER_CANCELLED = \"E_PICKER_CANCELLED\";\n  private static final String E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER = \"E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER\";\n  private static final String E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND = \"E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND\";\n\n  private Promise mPickerPromise;\n\n  private final ActivityEventListener mActivityEventListener = new BaseActivityEventListener() {\n\n    @Override\n    public void onActivityResult(Activity activity, int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {\n      if (requestCode == IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST) {\n        if (mPickerPromise != null) {\n          if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_CANCELED) {\n            mPickerPromise.reject(E_PICKER_CANCELLED, \"Image picker was cancelled\");\n          } else if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {\n            Uri uri = intent.getData();\n\n            if (uri == null) {\n              mPickerPromise.reject(E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND, \"No image data found\");\n            } else {\n              mPickerPromise.resolve(uri.toString());\n            }\n          }\n\n          mPickerPromise = null;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  };\n\n  public ImagePickerModule(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\n    super(reactContext);\n\n    // Add the listener for `onActivityResult`\n    reactContext.addActivityEventListener(mActivityEventListener);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String getName() {\n    return \"ImagePickerModule\";\n  }\n\n  @ReactMethod\n  public void pickImage(final Promise promise) {\n    Activity currentActivity = getCurrentActivity();\n\n    if (currentActivity == null) {\n      promise.reject(E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST, \"Activity doesn't exist\");\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // Store the promise to resolve/reject when picker returns data\n    mPickerPromise = promise;\n\n    try {\n      final Intent galleryIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK);\n\n      galleryIntent.setType(\"image/*\");\n\n      final Intent chooserIntent = Intent.createChooser(galleryIntent, \"Pick an image\");\n\n      currentActivity.startActivityForResult(chooserIntent, IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n      mPickerPromise.reject(E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER, e);\n      mPickerPromise = null;\n    }\n  }\n}Listening to LifeCycle events #Listening to the activity's LifeCycle events such as onResume, onPause etc. is very similar to how we implemented ActivityEventListener. The module must implement LifecycleEventListener. Then, you need to register a listener in the module's constructor,reactContext.addLifecycleEventListener(this);Now you can listen to the activity's LifeCycle events by implementing the following methods:@Override\npublic void onHostResume() {\n    // Activity `onResume`\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void onHostPause() {\n    // Activity `onPause`\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void onHostDestroy() {\n    // Activity `onDestroy`\n}← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Native UI Components","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-android.html","content":"Native UI Components #There are tons of native UI widgets out there ready to be used in the latest apps - some of them are part of the platform, others are available as third-party libraries, and still more might be in use in your very own portfolio. React Native has several of the most critical platform components already wrapped, like ScrollView and TextInput, but not all of them, and certainly not ones you might have written yourself for a previous app. Fortunately, it's quite easy to wrap up these existing components for seamless integration with your React Native application.Like the native module guide, this too is a more advanced guide that assumes you are somewhat familiar with Android SDK programming. This guide will show you how to build a native UI component, walking you through the implementation of a subset of the existing ImageViewcomponent available in the core React Native library.ImageView example #For this example we are going to walk through the implementation requirements to allow the use of ImageViews in JavaScript.Native views are created and manipulated by extending ViewManager or more commonly SimpleViewManager . A SimpleViewManager is convenient in this case because it applies common properties such as background color, opacity, and Flexbox layout.These subclasses are essentially singletons - only one instance of each is created by the bridge. They vend native views to the NativeViewHierarchyManager, which delegates back to them to set and update the properties of the views as necessary. The ViewManagers are also typically the delegates for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge.Vending a view is simple:Create the ViewManager subclass.Implement the createViewInstance methodExpose view property setters using @ReactProp (or @ReactPropGroup) annotationRegister the manager in createViewManagers of the applications package.Implement the JavaScript module1. Create the ViewManager subclass #In this example we create view manager class ReactImageManager that extends SimpleViewManager of type ReactImageView. ReactImageView is the type of object managed by the manager, this will be the custom native view. Name returned by getName is used to reference the native view type from JavaScript....\n\npublic class ReactImageManager extends SimpleViewManager<ReactImageView> {\n\n  public static final String REACT_CLASS = \"RCTImageView\";\n\n  @Override\n  public String getName() {\n    return REACT_CLASS;\n  }2. Implement method createViewInstance #Views are created in the createViewInstance method, the view should initialize itself in its default state, any properties will be set via a follow up call to updateView.  @Override\n  public ReactImageView createViewInstance(ThemedReactContext context) {\n    return new ReactImageView(context, Fresco.newDraweeControllerBuilder(), mCallerContext);\n  }3. Expose view property setters using @ReactProp (or @ReactPropGroup) annotation #Properties that are to be reflected in JavaScript needs to be exposed as setter method annotated with @ReactProp (or @ReactPropGroup). Setter method should take view to be updated (of the current view type) as a first argument and property value as a second argument. Setter should be declared as a void method and should be public. Property type sent to JS is determined automatically based on the type of value argument of the setter. The following type of values are currently supported: boolean, int, float, double, String, Boolean, Integer, ReadableArray, ReadableMap.Annotation @ReactProp has one obligatory argument name of type String. Name assigned to the @ReactProp annotation linked to the setter method is used to reference the property on JS side.Except from name, @ReactProp annotation may take following optional arguments: defaultBoolean, defaultInt, defaultFloat. Those arguments should be of the corresponding primitive type (accordingly boolean, int, float) and the value provided will be passed to the setter method in case when the property that the setter is referencing has been removed from the component. Note that \"default\" values are only provided for primitive types, in case when setter is of some complex type, null will be provided as a default value in case when corresponding property gets removed.Setter declaration requirements for methods annotated with @ReactPropGroup are different than for @ReactProp, please refer to the @ReactPropGroup annotation class docs for more information about it.IMPORTANT! in ReactJS updating the property value will result in setter method call. Note that one of the ways we can update component is by removing properties that has been set before. In that case setter method will be called as well to notify view manager that property has changed. In that case \"default\" value will be provided (for primitive types \"default\" can value can be specified using defaultBoolean, defaultFloat, etc. arguments of @ReactProp annotation, for complex types setter will be called with value set to null).  @ReactProp(name = \"src\")\n  public void setSrc(ReactImageView view, @Nullable String src) {\n    view.setSource(src);\n  }\n\n  @ReactProp(name = \"borderRadius\", defaultFloat = 0f)\n  public void setBorderRadius(ReactImageView view, float borderRadius) {\n    view.setBorderRadius(borderRadius);\n  }\n\n  @ReactProp(name = ViewProps.RESIZE_MODE)\n  public void setResizeMode(ReactImageView view, @Nullable String resizeMode) {\n    view.setScaleType(ImageResizeMode.toScaleType(resizeMode));\n  }4. Register the ViewManager #The final Java step is to register the ViewManager to the application, this happens in a similar way to Native Modules, via the applications package member function createViewManagers.  @Override\n  public List<ViewManager> createViewManagers(\n                            ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\n    return Arrays.<ViewManager>asList(\n      new ReactImageManager()\n    );\n  }5. Implement the JavaScript module #The very final step is to create the JavaScript module that defines the interface layer between Java and JavaScript for the users of your new view. Much of the effort is handled by internal React code in Java and JavaScript and all that is left for you is to describe the propTypes.// ImageView.js\n\nimport { PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport { requireNativeComponent, View } from 'react-native';\n\nvar iface = {\n  name: 'ImageView',\n  propTypes: {\n    src: PropTypes.string,\n    borderRadius: PropTypes.number,\n    resizeMode: PropTypes.oneOf(['cover', 'contain', 'stretch']),\n    ...View.propTypes // include the default view properties\n  },\n};\n\nmodule.exports = requireNativeComponent('RCTImageView', iface);requireNativeComponent commonly takes two parameters, the first is the name of the native view and the second is an object that describes the component interface. The component interface should declare a friendly name for use in debug messages and must declare the propTypes reflected by the Native View. The propTypes are used for checking the validity of a user's use of the native view.  Note that if you need your JavaScript component to do more than just specify a name and propTypes, like do custom event handling, you can wrap the native component in a normal react component.  In that case, you want to pass in the wrapper component instead of iface to requireNativeComponent.  This is illustrated in the MyCustomView example below.Events #So now we know how to expose native view components that we can control easily from JS, but how do we deal with events from the user, like pinch-zooms or panning? When a native event occurs the native code should issue an event to the JavaScript representation of the View, and the two views are linked with the value returned from the getId() method.class MyCustomView extends View {\n   ...\n   public void onReceiveNativeEvent() {\n      WritableMap event = Arguments.createMap();\n      event.putString(\"message\", \"MyMessage\");\n      ReactContext reactContext = (ReactContext)getContext();\n      reactContext.getJSModule(RCTEventEmitter.class).receiveEvent(\n          getId(),\n          \"topChange\",\n          event);\n    }\n}The event name topChange maps to the onChange callback prop in JavaScript (mappings are in UIManagerModuleConstants.java). This callback is invoked with the raw event, which we typically process in the wrapper component to make a simpler API:// MyCustomView.js\n\nclass MyCustomView extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this._onChange = this._onChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  _onChange(event: Event) {\n    if (!this.props.onChangeMessage) {\n      return;\n    }\n    this.props.onChangeMessage(event.nativeEvent.message);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <RCTMyCustomView {...this.props} onChange={this._onChange} />;\n  }\n}\nMyCustomView.propTypes = {\n  /**\n   * Callback that is called continuously when the user is dragging the map.\n   */\n  onChangeMessage: React.PropTypes.func,\n  ...\n};\n\nvar RCTMyCustomView = requireNativeComponent(`RCTMyCustomView`, MyCustomView, {\n  nativeOnly: {onChange: true}\n});Note the use of nativeOnly above.  Sometimes you'll have some special properties that you need to expose for the native component, but don't actually want them as part of the API for the associated React component.  For example, Switch has a custom onChange handler for the raw native event, and exposes an onValueChange handler property that is invoked with just the boolean value rather than the raw event (similar to onChangeMessage in the example above).  Since you don't want these native only properties to be part of the API, you don't want to put them in propTypes, but if you don't you'll get an error.  The solution is simply to call them out via the nativeOnly option.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Headless JS","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html","content":"Headless JS #Headless JS is a way to run tasks in JavaScript while your app is in the background.

The Signing Your Applications page on Android Developers documentation describes the topic in detail. This guide covers the process in brief, as well as lists the steps required to packaging the JavaScript bundle.Generating a signing key #You can generate a private signing key using keytool. On Windows keytool must be run from C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdkx.x.x_x\\bin.$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000This command prompts you for passwords for the keystore and key, and to provide the Distinguished Name fields for your key. It then generates the keystore as a file called my-release-key.keystore.The keystore contains a single key, valid for 10000 days. The alias is a name that you will use later when signing your app, so remember to take note of the alias.Note: Remember to keep your keystore file private and never commit it to version control.Setting up gradle variables #Place the my-release-key.keystore file under the android/app directory in your project folder.Edit the file ~/.gradle/gradle.properties and add the following (replace ***** with the correct keystore password, alias and key password),MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore\nMYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias\nMYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=*****\nMYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=*****These are going to be global gradle variables, which we can later use in our gradle config to sign our app.Note about saving the keystore:Once you publish the app on the Play Store, you will need to republish your app under a different package name (losing all downloads and ratings) if you want to change the signing key at any point. So backup your keystore and don't forget the passwords.Note about security: If you are not keen on storing your passwords in plaintext and you are running OSX, you can also store your credentials in the Keychain Access app. Then you can skip the two last rows in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties.Adding signing config to your app's gradle config #Edit the file android/app/build.gradle in your project folder and add the signing config,...\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig { ... }\n    signingConfigs {\n        release {\n            if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {\n                storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)\n                storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD\n                keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS\n                keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    buildTypes {\n        release {\n            ...\n            signingConfig signingConfigs.release\n        }\n    }\n}\n...Generating the release APK #Simply run the following in a terminal:$ cd android && ./gradlew assembleReleaseGradle's assembleRelease will bundle all the JavaScript needed to run your app into the APK.

But sometimes, there are things you can improve (and many times it's not native code's fault at all!).The first step for debugging this jank is to answer the fundamental question of where your time is being spent during each 16ms frame. For that, we'll be using a standard Android profiling tool called systrace. But first...Make sure that JS dev mode is OFF!You should see __DEV__ === false, development-level warning are OFF, performance optimizations are ON in your application logs (which you can view using adb logcat)Profiling with Systrace #Systrace is a standard Android marker-based profiling tool (and is installed when you install the Android platform-tools package). Profiled code blocks are surrounded by markers start/end markers which are then visualized in a colorful chart format. Both the Android SDK and React Native framework provide standard markers that you can visualize.Collecting a trace #NOTE:Systrace support was added in react-native v0.15. You will need to build with that version to collect a trace.First, connect a device that exhibits the stuttering you want to investigate to your computer via USB and get it to the point right before the navigation/animation you want to profile. Run systrace as follows$ <path_to_android_sdk>/platform-tools/systrace/systrace.py --time=10 -o trace.html sched gfx view -a <your_package_name>A quick breakdown of this command:time is the length of time the trace will be collected in secondssched, gfx, and view are the android SDK tags (collections of markers) we care about: sched gives you information about what's running on each core of your phone, gfx gives you graphics info such as frame boundaries, and view gives you information about measure, layout, and draw passes-a <your_package_name> enables app-specific markers, specifically the ones built into the React Native framework. your_package_name can be found in the AndroidManifest.xml of your app and looks like com.example.appOnce the trace starts collecting, perform the animation or interaction you care about. At the end of the trace, systrace will give you a link to the trace which you can open in your browser.Reading the trace #After opening the trace in your browser (preferably Chrome), you should see something like this:If your trace .html file isn't opening correctly, check your browser console for the following:Since Object.observe was deprecated in recent browsers, you may have to open the file from the Google Chrome Tracing tool.

This is time spent waiting for the GPU to drain its command buffer from the previous frame.To mitigate this, you should:investigate using renderToHardwareTextureAndroid for complex, static content that is being animated/transformed (e.g. the Navigator slide/alpha animations)make sure that you are not using needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing, which is disabled by default, as it greatly increases the per-frame load on the GPU in most cases.If these don't help and you want to dig deeper into what the GPU is actually doing, you can check out Tracer for OpenGL ES.Creating new views on the UI thread #In the second scenario, you'll see something more like this:Notice that first the JS thread thinks for a bit, then you see some work done on the native modules thread, followed by an expensive traversal on the UI thread.There isn't an easy way to mitigate this unless you're able to postpone creating new UI until after the interaction, or you are able to simplify the UI you're creating. The react native team is working on a infrastructure level solution for this that will allow new UI to be created and configured off the main thread, allowing the interaction to continue smoothly.Still stuck? #If you are confused or stuck, please post ask on Stack Overflow with the react-native tag. If you are unable to get a response there, or find an issue with a core component, please File a Github issue.← PrevNext →You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!"},{"title":"Building React Native from source","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-building-from-source.html","content":"Building React Native from source #You will need to build React Native from source if you want to work on a new feature/bug fix, try out the latest features which are not released yet, or maintain your own fork with patches that cannot be merged to the core.Prerequisites #Assuming you have the Android SDK installed, run android to open the Android SDK Manager.Make sure you have the following installed:Android SDK version 23 (compileSdkVersion in build.gradle)SDK build tools version 23.0.1 (buildToolsVersion in build.gradle)Android Support Repository >= 17 (for Android Support Library)Android NDK (download links and installation instructions below)Point Gradle to your Android SDK: #Step 1:  Set environment variables through your local shell.Note: Files may vary based on shell flavor. See below for examples from common shells.bash: .bash_profile or .bashrczsh: .zprofile or .zshrcksh: .profile or $ENVExample:export ANDROID_SDK=/Users/your_unix_name/android-sdk-macosx\nexport ANDROID_NDK=/Users/your_unix_name/android-ndk/android-ndk-r10eStep 2: Create a local.properties file in the android directory of your react-native app with the following contents:Example:sdk.dir=/Users/your_unix_name/android-sdk-macosx\nndk.dir=/Users/your_unix_name/android-ndk/android-ndk-r10eDownload links for Android NDK #Mac OS (64-bit) - http://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r10e-darwin-x86_64.zipLinux (64-bit) - http://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r10e-linux-x86_64.zipWindows (64-bit) - http://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r10e-windows-x86_64.zipWindows (32-bit) - http://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r10e-windows-x86.zipYou can find further instructions on the official page.Building the source #1. Installing the fork #First, you need to install react-native from your fork. For example, to install the master branch from the official repo, run the following:npm install --save github:facebook/react-native#masterAlternatively, you can clone the repo to your node_modules directory and run npm install inside the cloned repo.2. Adding gradle dependencies #Add gradle-download-task as dependency in android/build.gradle:...\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.3.1'\n        classpath 'de.undercouch:gradle-download-task:3.1.2'\n\n        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong\n        // in the individual module build.gradle files\n    }\n...3. Adding the :ReactAndroid project #Add the :ReactAndroid project in android/settings.gradle:...\ninclude ':ReactAndroid'\n\nproject(':ReactAndroid').projectDir = new File(\n    rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native/ReactAndroid')\n...Modify your android/app/build.gradle to use the :ReactAndroid project instead of the pre-compiled library, e.g. - replace compile 'com.facebook.react:react-native:+' with compile project(':ReactAndroid'):...\ndependencies {\n    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1'\n\n    compile project(':ReactAndroid')\n\n    ...\n}\n...4. Making 3rd-party modules use your fork #If you use 3rd-party React Native modules, you need to override their dependencies so that they don't bundle the pre-compiled library. Otherwise you'll get an error while compiling - Error: more than one library with package name 'com.facebook.react'.Modify your android/app/build.gradle, and add:configurations.all {\n    exclude group: 'com.facebook.react', module: 'react-native'\n}Building from Android Studio #From the Welcome screen of Android Studio choose \"Import project\" and select the android folder of your app.You should be able to use the Run button to run your app on a device. Android Studio won't start the packager automatically, you'll need to start it by running npm start on the command line.Additional notes #Building from source can take a long time, especially for the first build, as it needs to download ~200 MB of artifacts and compile the native code. Every time you update the react-native version from your repo, the build directory may get deleted, and all the files are re-downloaded. To avoid this, you might want to change your build directory path by editing the ~/.gradle/init.gradle file:gradle.projectsLoaded {\n    rootProject.allprojects {\n        buildDir = \"/path/to/build/directory/${rootProject.name}/${project.name}\"\n    }\n}Testing #If you made changes to React Native and submit a pull request, all tests will run on your pull request automatically. To run the tests locally, see Testing.Troubleshooting #Gradle build fails in ndk-build.

This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\nand we are working on improving it behind the scenes.By default, the list looks for a key prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\nAlternatively, you can provide a custom keyExtractor prop.Props #ItemSeparatorComponent?: ?ReactClass<any> #Rendered in between each item, but not at the top or bottom.ListFooterComponent?: ?ReactClass<any> #Rendered at the bottom of all the items.ListHeaderComponent?: ?ReactClass<any> #Rendered at the top of all the items.columnWrapperStyle?: StyleObj #Optional custom style for multi-item rows generated when numColumns > 1data: ?Array<ItemT> #For simplicity, data is just a plain array.

Key is used for caching\nand as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks item.key, then\nfalls back to using the index, like React does.legacyImplementation?: ?boolean #numColumns: number #Multiple columns can only be rendered with horizontal={false}`` and will zig-zag like aflexWrap` layout. Items should all be the same height - masonry layouts are not supported.onEndReached?: ?(info: {distanceFromEnd: number}) => void #Called once when the scroll position gets within onEndReachedThreshold of the rendered\ncontent.onEndReachedThreshold?: ?number #onRefresh?: ?() => void #If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for \"Pull to Refresh\" functionality. Make\nsure to also set the refreshing prop correctly.onViewableItemsChanged?: ?(info: {viewableItems: Array<ViewToken>, changed: Array<ViewToken>}) => void #Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the\nviewablePercentThreshold prop.refreshing?: ?boolean #Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.renderItem: (info: {item: ItemT, index: number}) => ?React.Element<any> #Takes an item from data and renders it into the list. Typical usage:_renderItem = ({item}) => (\n  <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this._onPress(item)}>\n    <Text>{item.title}}</Text>\n  <TouchableOpacity/>\n);\n...\n<FlatList data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}]} renderItem={this._renderItem} />Provides additional metadata like index if you need it.viewabilityConfig?: ViewabilityConfig #See ViewabilityHelper for flow type and further documentation.Methods #scrollToEnd(params?: object) #Scrolls to the end of the content. May be janky without getItemLayout prop.scrollToIndex(params: object) #Scrolls to the item at a the specified index such that it is positioned in the viewable area\nsuch that viewPosition 0 places it at the top, 1 at the bottom, and 0.5 centered in the\nmiddle.May be janky without getItemLayout prop.scrollToItem(params: object) #Requires linear scan through data - use scrollToIndex instead if possible. May be janky\nwithout getItemLayout prop.scrollToOffset(params: object) #Scroll to a specific content pixel offset, like a normal ScrollView.recordInteraction() #Tells the list an interaction has occured, which should trigger viewability calculations, e.g.\nif waitForInteractions is true and the user has not scrolled.

vertically\nscrolling lists of changing data. The minimal API is to create a\nListView.DataSource, populate it with a simple\narray of data blobs, and instantiate a ListView component with that data\nsource and a renderRow callback which takes a blob from the data array and\nreturns a renderable component.Minimal example:class MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    const ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});\n    this.state = {\n      dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows(['row 1', 'row 2']),\n    };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <ListView\n        dataSource={this.state.dataSource}\n        renderRow={(rowData) => <Text>{rowData}</Text>}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}ListView also supports more advanced features, including sections with sticky\nsection headers, header and footer support, callbacks on reaching the end of\nthe available data (onEndReached) and on the set of rows that are visible\nin the device viewport change (onChangeVisibleRows), and several\nperformance optimizations.There are a few performance operations designed to make ListView scroll\nsmoothly while dynamically loading potentially very large (or conceptually\ninfinite) data sets:Only re-render changed rows - the rowHasChanged function provided to the\ndata source tells the ListView if it needs to re-render a row because the\nsource data has changed - see ListViewDataSource for more details.Rate-limited row rendering - By default, only one row is rendered per\nevent-loop (customizable with the pageSize prop). This breaks up the\nwork into smaller chunks to reduce the chance of dropping frames while\nrendering rows.Props #ScrollView props... #dataSource: ListViewDataSource #An instance of ListView.DataSource to useenableEmptySections?: bool #Flag indicating whether empty section headers should be rendered. In the future release\nempty section headers will be rendered by default, and the flag will be deprecated.\nIf empty sections are not desired to be rendered their indices should be excluded from sectionID object.initialListSize: number #How many rows to render on initial component mount. Use this to make\nit so that the first screen worth of data appears at one time instead of\nover the course of multiple frames.onChangeVisibleRows?: function #(visibleRows, changedRows) => voidCalled when the set of visible rows changes. visibleRows maps\n{ sectionID: { rowID: true }} for all the visible rows, and\nchangedRows maps { sectionID: { rowID: true | false }} for the rows\nthat have changed their visibility, with true indicating visible, and\nfalse indicating the view has moved out of view.onEndReached?: function #Called when all rows have been rendered and the list has been scrolled\nto within onEndReachedThreshold of the bottom. The native scroll\nevent is provided.onEndReachedThreshold: number #Threshold in pixels (virtual, not physical) for calling onEndReached.pageSize: number #Number of rows to render per event loop. Note: if your 'rows' are actually\ncells, i.e. they don't span the full width of your view (as in the\nListViewGridLayoutExample), you should set the pageSize to be a multiple\nof the number of cells per row, otherwise you're likely to see gaps at\nthe edge of the ListView as new pages are loaded.removeClippedSubviews?: bool #A performance optimization for improving scroll perf of\nlarge lists, used in conjunction with overflow: 'hidden' on the row\ncontainers. This is enabled by default.renderFooter?: function #() => renderableThe header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\non every render pass. If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\nin StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate. Footer is always\nat the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.renderHeader?: function #renderRow: function #(rowData, sectionID, rowID, highlightRow) => renderableTakes a data entry from the data source and its ids and should return\na renderable component to be rendered as the row. By default the data\nis exactly what was put into the data source, but it's also possible to\nprovide custom extractors. ListView can be notified when a row is\nbeing highlighted by calling highlightRow(sectionID, rowID). This\nsets a boolean value of adjacentRowHighlighted in renderSeparator, allowing you\nto control the separators above and below the highlighted row. The highlighted\nstate of a row can be reset by calling highlightRow(null).renderScrollComponent: function #(props) => renderableA function that returns the scrollable component in which the list rows\nare rendered.

If\nyou are targeting iOS only, you may also want to consider using\nNavigatorIOS as it leverages native UIKit\nnavigation.To set up the Navigator you provide one or more objects called routes,\nto identify each scene. You also provide a renderScene function that\nrenders the scene for each route object.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Text, Navigator, TouchableHighlight } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class NavAllDay extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Navigator\n        initialRoute={{ title: 'Awesome Scene', index: 0 }}\n        renderScene={(route, navigator) =>\n          <Text>Hello {route.title}!</Text>\n        }\n        style={{padding: 100}}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}In the above example, initialRoute is used to specify the first route. It\ncontains a title property that identifies the route. The renderScene\nprop returns a function that displays text based on the route's title.Additional Scenes #The first example demonstrated one scene. To set up multiple scenes, you pass\nthe initialRouteStack prop to Navigator:render() {\n  const routes = [\n    {title: 'First Scene', index: 0},\n    {title: 'Second Scene', index: 1},\n  ];\n  return (\n    <Navigator\n      initialRoute={routes[0]}\n      initialRouteStack={routes}\n      renderScene={(route, navigator) =>\n        <TouchableHighlight onPress={() => {\n          if (route.index === 0) {\n            navigator.push(routes[1]);\n          } else {\n            navigator.pop();\n          }\n        }}>\n        <Text>Hello {route.title}!</Text>\n        </TouchableHighlight>\n      }\n      style={{padding: 100}}\n    />\n  );\n}In the above example, a routes variable is defined with two route objects\nrepresenting two scenes. Each route has an index property that is used to\nmanage the scene being rendered. The renderScene method is changed to\neither push or pop the navigator depending on the current route's index.\nFinally, the Text component in the scene is now wrapped in a\nTouchableHighlight component to help trigger the navigator transitions.Navigation Bar #You can optionally pass in your own navigation bar by returning a\nNavigator.NavigationBar component to the navigationBar prop in\nNavigator. You can configure the navigation bar properties, through\nthe routeMapper prop. There you set up the left, right, and title\nproperties of the navigation bar:<Navigator\n  renderScene={(route, navigator) =>\n    // ...\n  }\n  navigationBar={\n     <Navigator.NavigationBar\n       routeMapper={{\n         LeftButton: (route, navigator, index, navState) =>\n          { return (<Text>Cancel</Text>); },\n         RightButton: (route, navigator, index, navState) =>\n           { return (<Text>Done</Text>); },\n         Title: (route, navigator, index, navState) =>\n           { return (<Text>Awesome Nav Bar</Text>); },\n       }}\n       style={{backgroundColor: 'gray'}}\n     />\n  }\n/>When configuring the left, right, and title items for the navigation bar,\nyou have access to info such as the current route object and navigation\nstate. This allows you to customize the title for each scene as well as\nthe buttons. For example, you can choose to hide the left button for one of\nthe scenes.Typically you want buttons to represent the left and right buttons. Building\non the previous example, you can set this up as follows:LeftButton: (route, navigator, index, navState) =>\n  {\n    if (route.index === 0) {\n      return null;\n    } else {\n      return (\n        <TouchableHighlight onPress={() => navigator.pop()}>\n          <Text>Back</Text>\n        </TouchableHighlight>\n      );\n    }\n  },This sets up a left navigator bar button that's visible on scenes after the\nthe first one. When the button is tapped the navigator is popped.Another type of navigation bar, with breadcrumbs, is provided by\nNavigator.BreadcrumbNavigationBar. You can also provide your own navigation\nbar by passing it through the navigationBar prop. See the\nUIExplorer\ndemo to try out both built-in navigation bars out and see how to use them.Scene Transitions #To change the animation or gesture properties of the scene, provide a\nconfigureScene prop to get the config object for a given route:<Navigator\n  renderScene={(route, navigator) =>\n    // ...\n  }\n  configureScene={(route, routeStack) =>\n    Navigator.SceneConfigs.FloatFromBottom}\n/>In the above example, the newly pushed scene will float up from the bottom.\nSee Navigator.SceneConfigs for default animations and more info on\navailable scene config options.Props #configureScene?: function #Optional function where you can configure scene animations and\ngestures.

It works exactly the same as it\nwould on a native app using UINavigationController, providing the same\nanimations and behavior from UIKIt.As the name implies, it is only available on iOS. Take a look at\nNavigator for a similar solution for your\ncross-platform needs, or check out\nreact-native-navigation, a\ncomponent that aims to provide native navigation on both iOS and Android.To set up the navigator, provide the initialRoute prop with a route\nobject. A route object is used to describe each scene that your app\nnavigates to. initialRoute represents the first route in your navigator.import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport { NavigatorIOS, Text } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class NavigatorIOSApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <NavigatorIOS\n        initialRoute={{\n          component: MyScene,\n          title: 'My Initial Scene',\n        }}\n        style={{flex: 1}}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyScene extends Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n    navigator: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n  }\n\n  _onForward = () => {\n    this.props.navigator.push({\n      title: 'Scene ' + nextIndex,\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <Text>Current Scene: { this.props.title }</Text>\n        <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onForward}>\n          <Text>Tap me to load the next scene</Text>\n        </TouchableHighlight>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}In this code, the navigator renders the component specified in initialRoute,\nwhich in this case is MyScene. This component will receive a route prop\nand a navigator prop representing the navigator. The navigator's navigation\nbar will render the title for the current scene, \"My Initial Scene\".You can optionally pass in a passProps property to your initialRoute.\nNavigatorIOS passes this in as props to the rendered component:initialRoute={{\n  component: MyScene,\n  title: 'My Initial Scene',\n  passProps: { myProp: 'foo' }\n}}You can then access the props passed in via {this.props.myProp}.Handling Navigation #To trigger navigation functionality such as pushing or popping a view, you\nhave access to a navigator object. The object is passed in as a prop to any\ncomponent that is rendered by NavigatorIOS. You can then call the\nrelevant methods to perform the navigation action you need:class MyView extends Component {\n  _handleBackPress() {\n    this.props.navigator.pop();\n  }\n\n  _handleNextPress(nextRoute) {\n    this.props.navigator.push(nextRoute);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const nextRoute = {\n      component: MyView,\n      title: 'Bar That',\n      passProps: { myProp: 'bar' }\n    };\n    return(\n      <TouchableHighlight onPress={() => this._handleNextPress(nextRoute)}>\n        <Text style={{marginTop: 200, alignSelf: 'center'}}>\n          See you on the other nav {this.props.myProp}!\n        </Text>\n      </TouchableHighlight>\n    );\n  }\n}You can also trigger navigator functionality from the NavigatorIOS\ncomponent:class NavvyIOS extends Component {\n  _handleNavigationRequest() {\n    this.refs.nav.push({\n      component: MyView,\n      title: 'Genius',\n      passProps: { myProp: 'genius' },\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <NavigatorIOS\n        ref='nav'\n        initialRoute={{\n          component: MyView,\n          title: 'Foo This',\n          passProps: { myProp: 'foo' },\n          rightButtonTitle: 'Add',\n          onRightButtonPress: () => this._handleNavigationRequest(),\n        }}\n        style={{flex: 1}}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}The code above adds a _handleNavigationRequest private method that is\ninvoked from the NavigatorIOS component when the right navigation bar item\nis pressed. To get access to the navigator functionality, a reference to it\nis saved in the ref prop and later referenced to push a new scene into the\nnavigation stack.Navigation Bar Configuration #Props passed to NavigatorIOS will set the default configuration\nfor the navigation bar. Props passed as properties to a route object will set\nthe configuration for that route's navigation bar, overriding any props\npassed to the NavigatorIOS component._handleNavigationRequest() {\n  this.refs.nav.push({\n    //...\n    passProps: { myProp: 'genius' },\n    barTintColor: '#996699',\n  });\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <NavigatorIOS\n      //...\n      style={{flex: 1}}\n      barTintColor='#ffffcc'\n    />\n  );\n}In the example above the navigation bar color is changed when the new route\nis pushed.Props #barTintColor?: string #The default background color of the navigation bar.initialRoute: {component: [object Object], title: [object Object], titleImage: [object Object], passProps: [object Object], backButtonIcon: [object Object], backButtonTitle: [object Object], leftButtonIcon: [object Object], leftButtonTitle: [object Object], leftButtonSystemIcon: [object Object], onLeftButtonPress: [object Object], rightButtonIcon: [object Object], rightButtonTitle: [object Object], rightButtonSystemIcon: [object Object], onRightButtonPress: [object Object], wrapperStyle: [object Object], navigationBarHidden: [object Object], shadowHidden: [object Object], tintColor: [object Object], barTintColor: [object Object], titleTextColor: [object Object], translucent: [object Object]} #NavigatorIOS uses route objects to identify child views, their props,\nand navigation bar configuration.

Make sure all\nyour data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.This is a PureComponent which means that it will not re-render if props remain shallow-\nequal. Make sure that everything your renderItem function depends on is passed as a prop that\nis not === after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on changes. This includes the\ndata prop and parent component state.In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\noffscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\nblank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\nand we are working on improving it behind the scenes.By default, the list looks for a key prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\nAlternatively, you can provide a custom keyExtractor prop.Props #ItemSeparatorComponent?: ?ReactClass<any> #Rendered in between adjacent Items within each section.ListFooterComponent?: ?ReactClass<any> #Rendered at the very end of the list.ListHeaderComponent?: ?ReactClass<any> #Rendered at the very beginning of the list.SectionSeparatorComponent?: ?ReactClass<any> #Rendered in between each section.keyExtractor: (item: Item, index: number) => string #Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index.

In practice, this is very tedious. For React Native, we decided to use web paradigm for this where you can nest text to achieve the same effect.import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';\n\nclass BoldAndBeautiful extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>\n        I am bold\n        <Text style={{color: 'red'}}>\n          and red\n        </Text>\n      </Text>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('BoldAndBeautiful', () => BoldAndBeautiful);Behind the scenes, React Native converts this to a flat NSAttributedString or SpannableString that contains the following information:\"I am bold and red\"\n0-9: bold\n9-17: bold, redNested Views (iOS Only) #On iOS, you can nest views within your Text component. Here's an example:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass BlueIsCool extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Text>\n        There is a blue square\n        <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} />\n        in between my text.\n      </Text>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('BlueIsCool', () => BlueIsCool);In order to use this feature, you must give the view a width and a height.Containers #The <Text> element is special relative to layout: everything inside is no longer using the flexbox layout but using text layout. This means that elements inside of a <Text> are no longer rectangles, but wrap when they see the end of the line.<Text>\n  <Text>First part and </Text>\n  <Text>second part</Text>\n</Text>\n// Text container: all the text flows as if it was one\n// |First part |\n// |and second |\n// |part       |\n\n<View>\n  <Text>First part and </Text>\n  <Text>second part</Text>\n</View>\n// View container: each text is its own block\n// |First part |\n// |and        |\n// |second part|Limited Style Inheritance #On the web, the usual way to set a font family and size for the entire document is to take advantage of inherited CSS properties like so:/* CSS, *not* React Native */\nhtml {\n  font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;\n  font-size: 11px;\n  color: #141823;\n}All elements in the document will inherit this font unless they or one of their parents specifies a new rule.In React Native, we are more strict about it: you must wrap all the text nodes inside of a <Text> component; you cannot have a text node directly under a <View>.// BAD: will raise exception, can't have a text node as child of a <View>\n<View>\n  Some text\n</View>\n\n// GOOD\n<View>\n  <Text>\n    Some text\n  </Text>\n</View>You also lose the ability to set up a default font for an entire subtree. The recommended way to use consistent fonts and sizes across your application is to create a component MyAppText that includes them and use this component across your app. You can also use this component to make more specific components like MyAppHeaderText for other kinds of text.<View>\n  <MyAppText>Text styled with the default font for the entire application</MyAppText>\n  <MyAppHeaderText>Text styled as a header</MyAppHeaderText>\n</View>Assuming that MyAppText is a component that simply renders out its children into a Text component with styling, then MyAppHeaderText can be defined as follows:class MyAppHeaderText extends Component {\n  render() {\n    <MyAppText>\n      <Text style={{fontSize: 20}}>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </Text>\n    </MyAppText>\n  }\n}Composing MyAppText in this way ensures that we get the styles from a top-level component, but leaves us the ability to add / override them in specific use cases.React Native still has the concept of style inheritance, but limited to text subtrees. In this case, the second part will be both bold and red.<Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>\n  I am bold\n  <Text style={{color: 'red'}}>\n    and red\n  </Text>\n</Text>We believe that this more constrained way to style text will yield better apps:(Developer) React components are designed with strong isolation in mind: You should be able to drop a component anywhere in your application, trusting that as long as the props are the same, it will look and behave the same way. Text properties that could inherit from outside of the props would break this isolation.(Implementor) The implementation of React Native is also simplified. We do not need to have a fontFamily field on every single element, and we do not need to potentially traverse the tree up to the root every time we display a text node. The style inheritance is only encoded inside of the native Text component and doesn't leak to other components or the system itself.You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!Examples #IOS #Edit on GitHub'use strict';\n\nconst Platform = require('Platform');\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactNative = require('react-native');\nvar {\n  Image,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Text,\n  View,\n  LayoutAnimation,\n} = ReactNative;\n\nclass Entity extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Text style={{fontWeight: '500', color: '#527fe4'}}>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </Text>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass AttributeToggler extends React.Component {\n  state = {fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: 15};\n\n  toggleWeight = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      fontWeight: this.state.fontWeight === 'bold' ?

Props provide configurability for several features, such as\nauto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard\ntypes, such as a numeric keypad.The simplest use case is to plop down a TextInput and subscribe to the\nonChangeText events to read the user input. There are also other events,\nsuch as onSubmitEditing and onFocus that can be subscribed to. A simple\nexample:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n\nclass UselessTextInput extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { text: 'Useless Placeholder' };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <TextInput\n        style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}\n        onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n        value={this.state.text}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// App registration and rendering\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => UselessTextInput);Note that some props are only available with multiline={true/false}.\nAdditionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element\n(e.g., borderBottomColor, borderLeftWidth, etc.) will not be applied if\nmultiline=false. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your TextInput\nin a View:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, View, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n\nclass UselessTextInput extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <TextInput\n        {...this.props} // Inherit any props passed to it; e.g., multiline, numberOfLines below\n        editable = {true}\n        maxLength = {40}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass UselessTextInputMultiline extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      text: 'Useless Multiline Placeholder',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // If you type something in the text box that is a color, the background will change to that\n  // color.\n  render() {\n    return (\n     <View style={{\n       backgroundColor: this.state.text,\n       borderBottomColor: '#000000',\n       borderBottomWidth: 1 }}\n     >\n       <UselessTextInput\n         multiline = {true}\n         numberOfLines = {4}\n         onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n         value={this.state.text}\n       />\n     </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// App registration and rendering\nAppRegistry.registerComponent(\n 'AwesomeProject',\n () => UselessTextInputMultiline\n);TextInput has by default a border at the bottom of its view. This border\nhas its padding set by the background image provided by the system, and it\ncannot be changed. Solutions to avoid this is to either not set height\nexplicitly, case in which the system will take care of displaying the border\nin the correct position, or to not display the border by setting\nunderlineColorAndroid to transparent.Note that on Android performing text selection in input can change\napp's activity windowSoftInputMode param to adjustResize.\nThis may cause issues with components that have position: 'absolute'\nwhile keyboard is active. To avoid this behavior either specify windowSoftInputMode\nin AndroidManifest.xml ( https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html )\nor control this param programmatically with native code.Props #View props... #autoCapitalize?: enum('none', 'sentences', 'words', 'characters') #Can tell TextInput to automatically capitalize certain characters.characters: all characters.words: first letter of each word.sentences: first letter of each sentence (default).none: don't auto capitalize anything.autoCorrect?: bool #If false, disables auto-correct. The default value is true.autoFocus?: bool #If true, focuses the input on componentDidMount.\nThe default value is false.blurOnSubmit?: bool #If true, the text field will blur when submitted.\nThe default value is true for single-line fields and false for\nmultiline fields. Note that for multiline fields, setting blurOnSubmit\nto true means that pressing return will blur the field and trigger the\nonSubmitEditing event instead of inserting a newline into the field.caretHidden?: bool #If true, caret is hidden. The default value is false.defaultValue?: node #Provides an initial value that will change when the user starts typing.\nUseful for simple use-cases where you do not want to deal with listening\nto events and updating the value prop to keep the controlled state in sync.editable?: bool #If false, text is not editable.

TextInput is a controlled\ncomponent, which means the native value will be forced to match this\nvalue prop if provided. For most uses, this works great, but in some\ncases this may cause flickering - one common cause is preventing edits\nby keeping value the same. In addition to simply setting the same value,\neither set editable={false}, or set/update maxLength to prevent\nunwanted edits without flicker.androiddisableFullscreenUI?: bool #When false, if there is a small amount of space available around a text input\n(e.g. landscape orientation on a phone), the OS may choose to have the user edit\nthe text inside of a full screen text input mode.

A Toolbar can display a logo,\nnavigation icon (e.g. hamburger menu), a title & subtitle and a list of actions. The title and\nsubtitle are expanded so the logo and navigation icons are displayed on the left, title and\nsubtitle in the middle and the actions on the right.If the toolbar has an only child, it will be displayed between the title and actions.Although the Toolbar supports remote images for the logo, navigation and action icons, this\nshould only be used in DEV mode where require('./some_icon.png') translates into a packager\nURL. In release mode you should always use a drawable resource for these icons. Using\nrequire('./some_icon.png') will do this automatically for you, so as long as you don't\nexplicitly use e.g. {uri: 'http://...'}, you will be good.Example:render: function() {\n  return (\n    <ToolbarAndroid\n      logo={require('./app_logo.png')}\n      title=\"AwesomeApp\"\n      actions={[{title: 'Settings', icon: require('./icon_settings.png'), show: 'always'}]}\n      onActionSelected={this.onActionSelected} />\n  )\n},\nonActionSelected: function(position) {\n  if (position === 0) { // index of 'Settings'\n    showSettings();\n  }\n}Props #View props... #actions?: [object Object] #Sets possible actions on the toolbar as part of the action menu. These are displayed as icons\nor text on the right side of the widget. If they don't fit they are placed in an 'overflow'\nmenu.This property takes an array of objects, where each object has the following keys:title: required, the title of this actionicon: the icon for this action, e.g. require('./some_icon.png')show: when to show this action as an icon or hide it in the overflow menu: always,\nifRoom or nevershowWithText: boolean, whether to show text alongside the icon or notcontentInsetEnd?: number #Sets the content inset for the toolbar ending edge.The content inset affects the valid area for Toolbar content other than\nthe navigation button and menu. Insets define the minimum margin for\nthese components and can be used to effectively align Toolbar content\nalong well-known gridlines.contentInsetStart?: number #Sets the content inset for the toolbar starting edge.The content inset affects the valid area for Toolbar content other than\nthe navigation button and menu. Insets define the minimum margin for\nthese components and can be used to effectively align Toolbar content\nalong well-known gridlines.logo?: optionalImageSource #Sets the toolbar logo.navIcon?: optionalImageSource #Sets the navigation icon.onActionSelected?: function #Callback that is called when an action is selected. The only argument that is passed to the\ncallback is the position of the action in the actions array.onIconClicked?: function #Callback called when the icon is selected.overflowIcon?: optionalImageSource #Sets the overflow icon.rtl?: bool #Used to set the toolbar direction to RTL.\nIn addition to this property you need to add  android:supportsRtl=\"true\"to your application

In general, this should only really be used if you need more flexibility than\nFlatList provides, e.g. for use with immutable data instead of plain arrays.Virtualization massively improves memory consumption and performance of large lists by\nmaintaining a finite render window of active items and replacing all items outside of the render\nwindow with appropriately sized blank space. The window adapts to scrolling behavior, and items\nare rendered incrementally with low-pri (after any running interactions) if they are far from the\nvisible area, or with hi-pri otherwise to minimize the potential of seeing blank space.Some caveats:Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\nyour data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.This is a PureComponent which means that it will not re-render if props remain shallow-\nequal. Make sure that everything your renderItem function depends on is passed as a prop that\nis not === after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on changes. This includes the\ndata prop and parent component state.In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\noffscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\nblank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\nand we are working on improving it behind the scenes.By default, the list looks for a key prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\nAlternatively, you can provide a custom keyExtractor prop.NOTE: LayoutAnimation and sticky section headers both have bugs when used with this and are\ntherefore not officially supported yet.NOTE: removeClippedSubviews might not be necessary and may cause bugs. If you see issues with\ncontent not rendering, try disabling it, and we may change the default there.Props #data?: any #The default accessor functions assume this is an Array<{key: string}> but you can override\ngetItem, getItemCount, and keyExtractor to handle any type of index-based data.debug?: ?boolean #debug will turn on extra logging and visual overlays to aid with debugging both usage and\nimplementation, but with a significant perf hit.disableVirtualization: boolean #DEPRECATED: Virtualization provides significant performance and memory optimizations, but fully\nunmounts react instances that are outside of the render window.

This should be enough to fill the screen but not\nmuch more.keyExtractor: (item: Item, index: number) => string #maxToRenderPerBatch: number #The maximum number of items to render in each incremental render batch. The more rendered at\nonce, the better the fill rate, but responsiveness my suffer because rendering content may\ninterfere with responding to button taps or other interactions.onEndReached?: ?(info: {distanceFromEnd: number}) => void #onEndReachedThreshold?: ?number #onLayout?: ?Function #onRefresh?: ?Function #If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for \"Pull to Refresh\" functionality.

This event can be handled by providing an optional options parameter,\nwith an onDismiss callback property { onDismiss: () => {} }.Alternatively, the dismissing behavior can be disabled altogether by providing\nan optional options parameter with the cancelable property set to false\ni.e. { cancelable: false }Example usage:// Works on both iOS and Android\nAlert.alert(\n  'Alert Title',\n  'My Alert Msg',\n  [\n    {text: 'Ask me later', onPress: () => console.log('Ask me later pressed')},\n    {text: 'Cancel', onPress: () => console.log('Cancel Pressed'), style: 'cancel'},\n    {text: 'OK', onPress: () => console.log('OK Pressed')},\n  ],\n  { cancelable: false }\n)Methods #static alert(title, message?, buttons?, options?, type?) #You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!Examples #Edit on GitHub'use strict';\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactNative = require('react-native');\nvar {\n  Alert,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Text,\n  TouchableHighlight,\n  View,\n} = ReactNative;\n\nvar UIExplorerBlock = require('./UIExplorerBlock');\n\n// corporate ipsum > lorem ipsum\nvar alertMessage = 'Credibly reintermediate next-generation potentialities after goal-oriented ' +\n                   'catalysts for change.

to build and maintain. Animated focuses on declarative relationships\nbetween inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and\nsimple start/stop methods to control time-based animation execution.The simplest workflow for creating an animation is to to create an\nAnimated.Value, hook it up to one or more style attributes of an animated\ncomponent, and then drive updates via animations using Animated.timing():Animated.timing(                            // Animate value over time\n  this.state.fadeAnim,                      // The value to drive\n  {\n    toValue: 1,                             // Animate to final value of 1\n  }\n).start();                                  // Start the animationRefer to the Animations guide to see\nadditional examples of Animated in action.Overview #There are two value types you can use with Animated:Animated.Value() for single valuesAnimated.ValueXY() for vectorsAnimated.Value can bind to style properties or other props, and can be\ninterpolated as well. A single Animated.Value can drive any number of\nproperties.Configuring animations #Animated provides three types of animation types. Each animation type\nprovides a particular animation curve that controls how your values animate\nfrom their initial value to the final value:Animated.decay() starts with an initial\nvelocity and gradually slows to a stop.Animated.spring() provides a simple\nspring physics model.Animated.timing() animates a value over time\nusing easing functions.In most cases, you will be using timing(). By default, it uses a symmetric\neaseInOut curve that conveys the gradual acceleration of an object to full\nspeed and concludes by gradually decelerating to a stop.Working with animations #Animations are started by calling start() on your animation. start()\ntakes a completion callback that will be called when the animation is done.\nIf the animation finished running normally, the completion callback will be\ninvoked with {finished: true}. If the animation is done because stop()\nwas called on it before it could finish (e.g. because it was interrupted by a\ngesture or another animation), then it will receive {finished: false}.Using the native driver #By using the native driver, we send everything about the animation to native\nbefore starting the animation, allowing native code to perform the animation\non the UI thread without having to go through the bridge on every frame.\nOnce the animation has started, the JS thread can be blocked without\naffecting the animation.You can use the native driver by specifying useNativeDriver: true in your\nanimation configuration. See the\nAnimations guide to learn\nmore.Animatable components #Only animatable components can be animated. These special components do the\nmagic of binding the animated values to the properties, and do targeted\nnative updates to avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation\nprocess on every frame. They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe\nby default.createAnimatedComponent()\ncan be used to make a component animatable.Animated exports the following animatable components using the above\nwrapper:Animated.ImageAnimated.ScrollViewAnimated.TextAnimated.ViewComposing animations #Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions:Animated.delay() starts an animation after\na given delay.Animated.parallel() starts a number of\nanimations at the same time.Animated.sequence() starts the animations\nin order, waiting for each to complete before starting the next.Animated.stagger() starts animations in\norder and in parallel, but with successive delays.Animations can also be chained together simply by setting the toValue of\none animation to be another Animated.Value. See\nTracking dynamic values in\nthe Animations guide.By default, if one animation is stopped or interrupted, then all other\nanimations in the group are also stopped.Combining animated values #You can combine two animated values via addition, multiplication, division,\nor modulo to make a new animated value:Animated.add()Animated.divide()Animated.modulo()Animated.multiply()Interpolation #The interpolate() function allows input ranges to map to different output\nranges. By default, it will extrapolate the curve beyond the ranges given,\nbut you can also have it clamp the output value. It uses lineal interpolation\nby default but also supports easing functions.interpolate()Read more about interpolation in the\nAnimation guide.Handling gestures and other events #Gestures, like panning or scrolling, and other events can map directly to\nanimated values using Animated.event(). This is done with a structured map\nsyntax so that values can be extracted from complex event objects. The first\nlevel is an array to allow mapping across multiple args, and that array\ncontains nested objects.Animated.event()For example, when working with horizontal scrolling gestures, you would do\nthe following in order to map event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x to\nscrollX (an Animated.Value): onScroll={Animated.event(\n   // scrollX = e.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x\n   [{ nativeEvent: {\n        contentOffset: {\n          x: scrollX\n        }\n      }\n    }]\n )}Methods #static decay(value, config) #Animates a value from an initial velocity to zero based on a decay\ncoefficient.Config is an object that may have the following options:velocity: Initial velocity.  Required.deceleration: Rate of decay.  Default 0.997.useNativeDriver: Uses the native driver when true. Default false.static timing(value, config) #Animates a value along a timed easing curve.

It makes\nsingle-touch gestures resilient to extra touches, and can be used to\nrecognize simple multi-touch gestures.By default, PanResponder holds an InteractionManager handle to block\nlong-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.It provides a predictable wrapper of the responder handlers provided by the\ngesture responder system.\nFor each handler, it provides a new gestureState object alongside the\nnative event object:onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}A native event is a synthetic touch event with the following form:nativeEventchangedTouches - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last eventidentifier - The ID of the touchlocationX - The X position of the touch, relative to the elementlocationY - The Y position of the touch, relative to the elementpageX - The X position of the touch, relative to the root elementpageY - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root elementtarget - The node id of the element receiving the touch eventtimestamp - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculationtouches - Array of all current touches on the screenA gestureState object has the following:stateID - ID of the gestureState- persisted as long as there at least\n one touch on screenmoveX - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touchmoveY - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touchx0 - the screen coordinates of the responder granty0 - the screen coordinates of the responder grantdx - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch starteddy - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch startedvx - current velocity of the gesturevy - current velocity of the gesturenumberActiveTouches - Number of touches currently on screenBasic Usage #  componentWillMount: function() {\n    this._panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n      // Ask to be the responder:\n      onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n      onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n      onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n\n      onPanResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {\n        // The guesture has started.

Simply replace the word Responder with\nPanResponder in each of the typical onResponder* callbacks. For\nexample, the config object would look like:onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}onPanResponderReject: (e, gestureState) => {...}onPanResponderGrant: (e, gestureState) => {...}onPanResponderStart: (e, gestureState) => {...}onPanResponderEnd: (e, gestureState) => {...}onPanResponderRelease: (e, gestureState) => {...}onPanResponderMove: (e, gestureState) => {...}onPanResponderTerminate: (e, gestureState) => {...}onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (e, gestureState) => {...}onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}In general, for events that have capture equivalents, we update the\ngestureState once in the capture phase and can use it in the bubble phase\nas well.Be careful with onStartShould* callbacks. They only reflect updated\ngestureState for start/end events that bubble/capture to the Node.\nOnce the node is the responder, you can rely on every start/end event\nbeing processed by the gesture and gestureState being updated\naccordingly.

But, ultimately the physical display only have a fixed number of pixels, for example 640×960 for iPhone 4 or 750×1334 for iPhone 6. iOS tries to be as faithful as possible to the user value by spreading one original pixel into multiple ones to trick the eye. The downside of this technique is that it makes the resulting element look blurry.In practice, we found out that developers do not want this feature and they have to work around it by doing manual rounding in order to avoid having blurry elements. In React Native, we are rounding all the pixels automatically.We have to be careful when to do this rounding. You never want to work with rounded and unrounded values at the same time as you're going to accumulate rounding errors. Having even one rounding error is deadly because a one pixel border may vanish or be twice as big.In React Native, everything in JS and within the layout engine work with arbitrary precision numbers. It's only when we set the position and dimensions of the native element on the main thread that we round. Also, rounding is done relative to the root rather than the parent, again to avoid accumulating rounding errors.You can edit the content above on GitHub and send us a pull request!← PrevNext →"},{"title":"PushNotificationIOS","href":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pushnotificationios.html","content":"PushNotificationIOS #Handle push notifications for your app, including permission handling and\nicon badge number.To get up and running, configure your notifications with Apple\nand your server-side system.

&& styles.activeTitle]} />\n</View>Code quality:By moving styles away from the render function, you're making the code\neasier to understand.Naming the styles is a good way to add meaning to the low level components\nin the render function.Performance:Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it\nby ID instead of creating a new style object every time.It also allows to send the style only once through the bridge. All\nsubsequent uses are going to refer an id (not implemented yet).Methods #static setStyleAttributePreprocessor(property, process) #WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL. Breaking changes will probably happen a lot and will\nnot be reliably announced. The whole thing might be deleted, who knows? Use\nat your own risk.Sets a function to use to pre-process a style property value. This is used\ninternally to process color and transform values. You should not use this\nunless you really know what you are doing and have exhausted other options.static create(obj) #Creates a StyleSheet style reference from the given object.Properties #hairlineWidth: [object Object] #This is defined as the width of a thin line on the platform. It can be\nused as the thickness of a border or division between two elements.\nExample:  {\n    borderBottomColor: '#bbb',\n    borderBottomWidth: StyleSheet.hairlineWidth\n  }This constant will always be a round number of pixels (so a line defined\nby it look crisp) and will try to match the standard width of a thin line\non the underlying platform. However, you should not rely on it being a\nconstant size, because on different platforms and screen densities its\nvalue may be calculated differently.A line with hairline width may not be visible if your simulator is downscaled.absoluteFill: [object Object] #A very common pattern is to create overlays with position absolute and zero positioning,\nso absoluteFill can be used for convenience and to reduce duplication of these repeated\nstyles.absoluteFillObject: [object Object] #Sometimes you may want absoluteFill but with a couple tweaks - absoluteFillObject can be\nused to create a customized entry in a StyleSheet, e.g.:  const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n    wrapper: {\n      ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,\n      top: 10,\n      backgroundColor: 'transparent',\n    },\n  });flatten: [object Object] #Flattens an array of style objects, into one aggregated style object.\nAlternatively, this method can be used to lookup IDs, returned by\nStyleSheet.register.NOTE: Exercise caution as abusing this can tax you in terms of\noptimizations.IDs enable optimizations through the bridge and memory in general. Refering\nto style objects directly will deprive you of these optimizations.Example:var styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  listItem: {\n    flex: 1,\n    fontSize: 16,\n    color: 'white'\n  },\n  selectedListItem: {\n    color: 'green'\n  }\n});\n\nStyleSheet.flatten([styles.listItem, styles.selectedListItem])\n// returns { flex: 1, fontSize: 16, color: 'green' }Alternative use:StyleSheet.flatten(styles.listItem);\n// return { flex: 1, fontSize: 16, color: 'white' }\n// Simply styles.listItem would return its ID (number)This method internally uses StyleSheetRegistry.getStyleByID(style)\nto resolve style objects represented by IDs. Thus, an array of style\nobjects (instances of StyleSheet.create), are individually resolved to,\ntheir respective objects, merged as one and then returned.
